Bodies of intrusive rock are known as intrusions and are surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock ). The country rock is an excellent thermal insulator , so the magma cools slowly, and intrusive rocks are coarse-grained ( phaneritic ). The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusions can be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the bedding of the country rock into which it intrudes.

The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths ) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface. Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal ) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually much finer-grained, often resembling volcanic rock.

        "text": "Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body. The classification of the many types of igneous rocks can provide important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars , quartz or feldspathoids , olivines , pyroxenes , amphiboles , and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals . Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, but include carbonatites , which contain essential carbonates . [17] In a simplified compositional classification, igneous rock types are categorized into felsic or mafic based on the abundance of silicate minerals in the Bowen's Series.  Rocks dominated by quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar and muscovite are felsic.  Mafic rocks are primarily composed of biotite, hornblende, pyroxene and olivine.  Generally, felsic rocks are light colored and mafic rocks are darker colored. [18] For textural classification, igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic ; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic . Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin or plutonic, indicating slow cooling; aphanitic are extrusive or volcanic, indicating rapid cooling. [18] An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry . Porphyritic texture develops when the larger crystals, called phenocrysts, grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material called groundmass.  Grain size in igneous rocks results from cooling time so porphyritic rocks are created when the magma has two distinct phases of cooling. [18] Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.

        "text": "Most magmas are fully melted only for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve. As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures ( fractional crystallization ). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200\u00a0\u00b0C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700\u00a0\u00b0C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite , a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma. Clinopyroxene thermobarometry is used to determine temperature and pressure conditions at which magma differentiation occurred for specific igneous rocks. [ citation needed ] Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions. [ citation needed ]",

This process can alter the composition of the residual melt, potentially transforming a gabbroic magma into a granitic composition.

        "text": "Metamorphic rocks are one of the three great divisions of all rock types, and so there is a great variety of metamorphic rock types. In general, if the protolith of a metamorphic rock can be determined, the rock is described by adding the prefix meta- to the protolith rock name. For example, if the protolith is known to be basalt , the rock will be described as a metabasalt. Likewise, a metamorphic rock whose protolith is known to be a conglomerate will be described as a metaconglomerate . For a metamorphic rock to be classified in this manner, the protolith should be identifiable from the characteristics of the metamorphic rock itself, and not inferred from other information. [21] [22] [23] Under the British Geological Survey's classification system, if all that can be determined about the protolith is its general type, such as sedimentary or volcanic, the classification is based on the mineral mode (the volume percentages of different minerals in the rock). Metasedimentary rocks are divided into carbonate-rich rock (metacarbonates or calcsilicate-rocks) or carbonate-poor rocks, and the latter are further classified by the relative abundance of mica in their composition. This ranges from low-mica psammite through semipelite to high-mica pelite . Psammites composed mostly of quartz are classified as quartzite. Metaigneous rocks are classified similarly to igneous rocks, by silica content, from meta-ultramafic-rock (which is very low in silica) to metafelsic-rock (with a high silica content). [22] Where the mineral mode cannot be determined, as is often the case when rock is first examined in the field , then classification must be based on texture. The textural types are: A hornfels is a granofels that is known to result from contact metamorphism. A slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that easily splits into thin plates but shows no obvious compositional layering. The term is used only when very little else is known about the rock that would allow a more definite classification. Textural classifications may be prefixed to indicate a sedimentary protolith ( para- , such as paraschist) or igneous protolith ( ortho- , such as orthogneiss). When nothing is known about the protolith, the textural name is used without a prefix. For example, a schist is a rock with schistose texture whose protolith is uncertain. [22] Special classifications exist for metamorphic rocks with a volcaniclastic protolith or formed along a fault or through hydrothermal circulation . A few special names are used for rocks of unknown protolith but known modal composition, such as marble, eclogite , or amphibolite . [22] Special names may also be applied more generally to rocks dominated by a single mineral, or with a distinctive composition or mode or origin. Special names still in wide use include amphibolite, greenschist , phyllite, marble, serpentinite , eclogite, migmatite , skarn , granulite , mylonite, and slate. [23] The basic classification can be supplemented by terms describing mineral content or texture. For example, a metabasalt showing weak schistosity might be described as a gneissic metabasalt, and a pelite containing abundant staurolite might be described as a staurolite pelite. [22] [23]",

        "text": "Metamorphic rocks are typically more coarsely crystalline than the protolith from which they formed. Atoms in the interior of a crystal are surrounded by a stable arrangement of neighboring atoms. This is partially missing at the surface of the crystal, producing a surface energy that makes the surface thermodynamically unstable. Recrystallization to coarser crystals reduces the surface area and so minimizes the surface energy. [17] Although grain coarsening is a common result of metamorphism, rock that is intensely deformed may eliminate strain energy by recrystallizing as a fine-grained rock called mylonite . Certain kinds of rock, such as those rich in quartz, carbonate minerals , or olivine, are particularly prone to form mylonites, while feldspar and garnet are resistant to mylonitization. [18]",

        "text": "Metamorphism is the set of processes by which existing rock is transformed physically or chemically at elevated temperature, without actually melting to any great degree. The importance of heating in the formation of metamorphic rock was first recognized by the pioneering Scottish naturalist, James Hutton , who is often described as the father of modern geology. Hutton wrote in 1795 that some rock beds of the Scottish Highlands had originally been sedimentary rock , but had been transformed by great heat. [3] Hutton also speculated that pressure was important in metamorphism. This hypothesis was tested by his friend, James Hall , who sealed chalk into a makeshift pressure vessel constructed from a cannon barrel and heated it in an iron foundry furnace. Hall found that this produced a material strongly resembling marble , rather than the usual quicklime produced by heating of chalk in the open air. French geologists subsequently added metasomatism , the circulation of fluids through buried rock, to the list of processes that help bring about metamorphism. However, metamorphism can take place without metasomatism (isochemical metamorphism) or at depths of just a few hundred meters where pressures are relatively low (for example, in contact metamorphism). [3] Rock can be transformed without melting because heat causes atomic bonds to break, freeing the atoms to move and form new bonds with other atoms . Pore fluid present between mineral grains is an important medium through which atoms are exchanged. [4] This permits recrystallization of existing minerals or crystallization of new minerals with different crystalline structures or chemical compositions (neocrystallization). [1] The transformation converts the minerals in the protolith into forms that are more stable (closer to chemical equilibrium ) under the conditions of pressure and temperature at which metamorphism takes place. [5] [6] Metamorphism is generally regarded to begin at temperatures of 100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (212 to 392\u00a0\u00b0F). This excludes diagenetic changes due to compaction and lithification , which result in the formation of sedimentary rocks. [7] The upper boundary of metamorphic conditions lies at the solidus of the rock, which is the temperature at which the rock begins to melt. At this point, the process becomes an igneous process. [8] The solidus temperature depends on the composition of the rock, the pressure, and whether the rock is saturated with water. Typical solidus temperatures range from 650\u00a0\u00b0C (1,202\u00a0\u00b0F) for wet granite at a few hundred megapascals (MPa) of pressure [9] to about 1,080\u00a0\u00b0C (1,980\u00a0\u00b0F) for wet basalt at atmospheric pressure. [10] Migmatites are rocks formed at this upper limit, which contains pods and veins of material that has started to melt but has not fully segregated from the refractory residue. [11] The metamorphic process can occur at almost any pressure, from near surface pressure (for contact metamorphism) to pressures in excess of 16 kbar (1600 MPa). [12]",

Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during recrystallization. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite , to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage . Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale , and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates. [19] The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone , the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite , which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss , which is coarse to very coarse-grained. [20] Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.",

The facies are named after the metamorphic rock formed under those facies conditions from basalt . [79] The particular mineral assemblage is somewhat dependent on the composition of that protolith, so that (for example) the amphibolite facies of a marble will not be identical with the amphibolite facies of a pellite. However, the facies are defined such that metamorphic rock with as broad a range of compositions as is practical can be assigned to a particular facies. The present definition of metamorphic facies is largely based on the work of the Finnish geologist, Pentti Eskola in 1921, with refinements based on subsequent experimental work. Eskola drew upon the zonal schemes, based on index minerals, that were pioneered by the British geologist, George Barrow . [12] The metamorphic facies is not usually considered when classifying metamorphic rock based on protolith, mineral mode, or texture. However, a few metamorphic facies produce rock of such distinctive character that the facies name is used for the rock when more precise classification is not possible. The chief examples are amphibolite and eclogite . The British Geological Survey strongly discourages use of granulite as a classification for rock metamorphosed to the granulite facies. Instead, such rock will often be classified as a granofels. [76] However, this is not universally accepted. [77] See diagram for more detail.",

        "text": "To many geologists, regional metamorphism is practically synonymous with dynamothermal metamorphism. [30] This form of metamorphism takes place at convergent plate boundaries , where two continental plates or a continental plate and an island arc collide. The collision zone becomes a belt of mountain formation called an orogeny . The orogenic belt is characterized by thickening of the Earth's crust, during which the deeply buried crustal rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures and is intensely deformed. [33] [34] Subsequent erosion of the mountains exposes the roots of the orogenic belt as extensive outcrops of metamorphic rock, [35] characteristic of mountain chains. [33] Metamorphic rock formed in these settings tends to shown well-developed foliation . [33] Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during metamorphism. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite , to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage . Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale , and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates. [36] The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone , the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite , which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss , which is coarse to very coarse-grained. [37] Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture. Collisional orogenies are preceded by subduction of oceanic crust. [38] The conditions within the subducting slab as it plunges toward the mantle in a subduction zone produce their own distinctive regional metamorphic effects , characterized by paired metamorphic belts . [39] The pioneering work of George Barrow on regional metamorphism in the Scottish Highlands showed that some regional metamorphism produces well-defined, mappable zones of increasing metamorphic grade. This Barrovian metamorphism is the most recognized metamorphic series in the world. However, Barrovian metamorphism is specific to pelitic rock, formed from mudstone or siltstone , and it is not unique even in pelitic rock. A different sequence in the northeast of Scotland defines Buchan metamorphism , which took place at lower pressure than the Barrovian. [40]",

        "text": "Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock type\u2014sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock\u2014to different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed. This process is called metamorphism , meaning to \"change in form\". The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone. The original rock, known as the protolith , transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals, by recrystallization . [5] The temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher than those found at the Earth's surface: temperatures greater than 150 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures greater than 1500\u00a0bars. [18] This occurs, for example, when continental plates collide. [19] :\u200a31\u201333,\u200a134\u2013139 Metamorphic rocks compose 27.4% of the crust by volume. [13] The three major classes of metamorphic rock are based upon the formation mechanism. An intrusion of magma that heats the surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism\u2014a temperature-dominated transformation. Pressure metamorphism occurs when sediments are buried deep under the ground; pressure is dominant, and temperature plays a smaller role. This is termed burial metamorphism, and it can result in rocks such as jade . Where both heat and pressure play a role, the mechanism is termed regional metamorphism. This is typically found in mountain-building regions. [7] Depending on the structure, metamorphic rocks are divided into two general categories. Those that possess a texture are referred to as foliated ; the remainders are termed non-foliated. The name of the rock is then determined based on the types of minerals present. Schists are foliated rocks that are primarily composed of lamellar minerals such as micas . A gneiss has visible bands of differing lightness , with a common example being the granite gneiss. Other varieties of foliated rock include slates , phyllites , and mylonite . Familiar examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks include marble , soapstone , and serpentine . This branch contains quartzite \u2014a metamorphosed form of sandstone \u2014and hornfels . [7]",

This rock forms through regional metamorphism, where both heat and pressure play significant roles. Regional metamorphism typically occurs in mountain-building regions when continental plates collide, subjecting existing rocks to high temperatures (greater than 150-200\u00b0C) and pressures (greater than 1500 bars). During this process, the original rock, known as the protolith, undergoes profound changes in physical properties and chemistry, transforming into new mineral types through recrystallization. Gneiss is primarily composed of lamellar minerals such as micas, which contribute to its banded appearance."

[59] A special type of contact metamorphism, associated with fossil fuel fires, is known as pyrometamorphism . [60] [61]",

        "text": "Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word igneus, meaning of fire, from ignis meaning fire) [9] is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava . This magma may be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet 's mantle or crust . Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. [10] :\u200a591\u2013599 Igneous rocks are divided into two main categories: Magmas tend to become richer in silica as they rise towards the Earth's surface, a process called magma differentiation . This occurs both because minerals low in silica crystallize out of the magma as it begins to cool ( Bowen's reaction series ) and because the magma assimilates some of the crustal rock through which it ascends ( country rock ), and crustal rock tends to be high in silica. Silica content is thus the most important chemical criterion for classifying igneous rock. [7] The content of alkali metal oxides is next in importance. [11] About 65% of the Earth's crust by volume consists of igneous rocks. Of these, 66% are basalt and gabbro , 16% are granite, and 17% granodiorite and diorite . Only 0.6% are syenite and 0.3% are ultramafic . The oceanic crust is 99% basalt, which is an igneous rock of mafic composition. Granite and similar rocks, known as granitoids , dominate the continental crust . [12] [13]",

For instance, in Egypt as early as 4000 BCE, easily workable sedimentary rock was quarried for construction purposes. Similarly, in Inner Mongolia around 2800 BCE, soft rock was used to construct fortifications. The Romans utilized soft rock like tuff in Italy for building numerous structures, including buildings and bridges.
