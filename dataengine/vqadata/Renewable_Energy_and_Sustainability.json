This energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point, depending on whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customer's energy consumption ( feed-in tariff ) or only on the difference of energy ( net metering ). These systems vary in size from residential (2\u201310\u00a0kW p ) to solar power stations (up to tens of MW p ). This is a form of decentralized electricity generation . Feeding electricity into the grid requires the transformation of DC into AC by a special, synchronizing grid-tie inverter . In kilowatt-sized installations the DC side system voltage is as high as permitted (typically 1000 V except US residential 600\u00a0V) to limit ohmic losses. Most modules (60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells) generate 160\u00a0W to 300\u00a0W at 36 volts.

        "text": "A photovoltaic system converts the Sun's radiation , in the form of light, into usable electricity . It comprises the solar array and the balance of system components. PV systems can be categorized by various aspects, such as, grid-connected vs. stand alone systems, building-integrated vs. rack-mounted systems, residential vs. utility systems, distributed vs. centralized systems, rooftop vs. ground-mounted systems, tracking vs. fixed-tilt systems, and new constructed vs. retrofitted systems. Other distinctions may include, systems with microinverters vs. central inverter, systems using crystalline silicon vs. thin-film technology , and systems with modules. About 99 percent of all European and 90 percent of all U.S. solar power systems are connected to the electrical grid , while off-grid systems are somewhat more common in Australia and South Korea. [4] :\u200a14 PV systems rarely use battery storage. This may change, as government incentives for distributed energy storage are implemented and investments in storage solutions gradually become economically viable for small systems. [5] [6] A typical residential solar array is rack-mounted on the roof, rather than integrated into the roof or facade of the building, which is significantly more expensive. Utility-scale solar power stations are ground-mounted, with fixed tilted solar panels rather than using expensive tracking devices. Crystalline silicon is the predominant material used in 90 percent of worldwide produced solar modules, while its rival thin-film has lost market-share. [7] :\u200a17\u201320 About 70 percent of all solar cells and modules are produced in China and Taiwan, only 5 percent by European and US- manufacturers . [7] :\u200a11\u201312 The installed capacity for both small rooftop systems and large solar power stations is growing rapidly and in equal parts, although there is a notable trend towards utility-scale systems, as the focus on new installations is shifting away from Europe to sunnier regions, such as the Sunbelt in the U.S., which are less opposed to ground-mounted solar farms and cost-effectiveness is more emphasized by investors. [4] :\u200a43 Driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaics is declining continuously. [8] There are several million PV systems distributed all over the world, mostly in Europe, with 1.4 million systems in Germany alone [7] :\u200a5 \u2013\u00a0as well as North America with 440,000 systems in the United States. [9] The energy conversion efficiency of a conventional solar module increased from 15 to 20 percent since 2004 [7] :\u200a17 and a PV system recoups the energy needed for its manufacture in about 2 years. In exceptionally irradiated locations, or when thin-film technology is used, the so-called energy payback time decreases to one year or less. [7] :\u200a30\u201333 Net metering and financial incentives, such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have also greatly supported installations of PV systems in many countries. [10] The levelised cost of electricity from large-scale PV systems has become competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions, and grid parity has been achieved in about 30 countries. [11] [12] [13] [14] As of 2015, the fast-growing global PV market is rapidly approaching the 200\u00a0GW mark \u2013 about 40 times the installed capacity in 2006. [15] These systems currently contribute about 1 percent to worldwide electricity generation. Top installers of PV systems in terms of capacity are currently China, Japan and the United States, while half of the world's capacity is installed in Europe, with Germany and Italy supplying 7% to 8% of their respective domestic electricity consumption with solar PV. [16] The International Energy Agency expects solar power to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar thermal contributing 16% and 11% to the global demand, respectively.

In 2013, rooftop systems accounted for 60 percent of worldwide installations. However, there is a trend away from rooftop and towards utility-scale PV systems, as the focus of new PV installations is also shifting from Europe to countries in the sunbelt region of the planet where opposition to ground-mounted solar farms is less accentuated. [4] :\u200a43 Portable and mobile PV systems provide electrical power independent of utility connections, for \"off the grid\" operation. Such systems are so commonly used on recreational vehicles and boats that there are retailers specializing in these applications and products specifically targeted to them. Since recreational vehicles (RV) normally carry batteries and operate lighting and other systems on nominally 12-volt DC power, RV systems normally operate in a voltage range that can charge 12-volt batteries directly, so addition of a PV system requires only panels, a charge controller, and wiring. Solar systems on recreation vehicles are usually constrained in wattage by the physical size of the RV's roof space. [22]",

        "text": "Solar insolation is made up of direct, diffuse, and reflected radiation . The absorption factor of a PV cell is defined as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. [57] When the sun is at the zenith on a cloudless day, the power of the sun is about 1 kW /m 2 , [58] on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can track the sun through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face due south in the northern hemisphere or due north in the southern hemisphere. The tilt angle from horizontal can be varied for season, [59] but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output. [60] The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, later work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the spectrum of the albedo of the surroundings can play a significant role in output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system [61] and the type of solar cell material. [62] A photovoltaic installation in the northern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m 2 /day. [ citation needed ] A typical 1\u00a0kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5\u20135\u00a0kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors. [ citation needed ] In the Sahara desert, with less cloud cover and a better solar angle, one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kWh/m 2 /day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units. The area of the Sahara desert is over 9 million km 2 . 90,600\u00a0km 2 , or about 1%, could generate as much electricity as all of the world's power plants combined. [63]",

While tracking the sun through the day can enhance energy collection, fixed mounts are more common due to lower cost and maintenance requirements. In regions like the Sahara desert, where insolation is high and cloud cover minimal, a properly tilted PV array could ideally generate closer to 8.3 kWh/m\u00b2/day.

Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid. [83] In some countries, for installations over 30 kW p a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required. This is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or stored . Grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity. Now they need to also provide storage. This is normally hydro-storage, but other means of storage are used. Initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output. With variable renewable energy , storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever needed. The two variables a grid operator has are storing electricity for when it is needed, or transmitting it to where it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over 30kWp can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. Grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems, although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power, and results in a substantial loss of revenue. [84] Three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements. [85] Photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize operation. There are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software. [86] Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent smart meters may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter (a pyranometer ) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison. [87] Data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over the World Wide Web, such as OSOTF . [88] [89] [90] [91]",

Depending on the type of tracking system, the panel is either aimed directly at the Sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky. Trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance, increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 20\u201325% for a single axis tracker and about 30% or more for a dual axis tracker, depending on latitude. [64] [65] Trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly. In diffuse light (i.e. under cloud or fog), tracking has little or no value. Because most concentrated photovoltaics systems are very sensitive to the sunlight's angle, tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day. [66] Tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons. First, when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight, it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled. Second, direct light is used more efficiently than angled light. [67] Special anti-reflective coatings can improve solar panel efficiency for direct and angled light, somewhat reducing the benefit of tracking. [68] Trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional, but they can increase viable output by up to 45%. [69] Arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers. Considering clouds, and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator, and that the sun sets in the evening, the correct measure of solar power is insolation \u2013 the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 2.26\u00a0kWh/m 2 /day in northern climes to 5.61\u00a0kWh/m 2 /day in the sunniest regions. [70] [71] For large systems, the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity. For very large systems , the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment. [72] Tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration photovoltaic systems . For high-concentration photovoltaic systems, dual axis tracking is a necessity. [73] Pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track. As pricing, reliability and performance of single-axis trackers have improved, the systems have been installed in an increasing percentage of utility-scale projects. According to data from WoodMackenzie/GTM Research, global solar tracker shipments hit a record 14.5 gigawatts in 2017. This represents growth of 32 percent year-over-year, with similar or greater growth projected as large-scale solar deployment accelerates. [74]",

[122] A price decrease of 50% had been achieved in Europe from 2006 to 2011, and there was a potential to lower the generation cost by 50% by 2020. [123] Crystal silicon solar cells have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells, and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed at lower costs of production. Although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline \"siwafers\", they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs. [124] The table below shows the total (average) cost in US cents per kWh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system. [125] [126] The row headings on the left show the total cost, per peak kilowatt (kW p ), of a photovoltaic installation. Photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in Germany, for example, were reported to have fallen to USD 1389/kW p by the end of 2014. [127] The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kWh expected from each installed kW p . This varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon. \nPanels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude, and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar declination .

Performance varies depending on geographic location, time of day, the day of the year, amount of solar irradiance , direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, soiling , state of charge, and temperature. Performance of a module or panel can be measured at different time intervals with a DC clamp meter or shunt and logged, graphed, or charted with a chart recorder or data logger. For optimum performance, a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular to direct sunlight. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels and optimize output. These bypass diodes are usually placed along groups of solar cells to create a continuous flow. [35] Electrical characteristics include nominal power (P MAX , measured in W ), open-circuit voltage (V OC ), short-circuit current (I SC , measured in amperes ), maximum power voltage (V MPP ), maximum power current (I MPP ), peak power ( watt-peak , W p ), and module efficiency (%). Open-circuit voltage or V OC is the maximum voltage the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system.

The photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands. Pellworm island in Germany and Kythnos island in Greece are notable examples (both are combined with wind). [92] [93] The Kythnos plant has reduced diesel consumption by 11.2%. [94] In 2015, a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids. However, financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant. While cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant, the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities, such as independent power producers . [95] [96] There has also been work showing that the PV penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of PV+CHP hybrid systems in the U.S. [97] The temporal distribution of solar flux, electrical and heating requirements for representative U.S. single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing CHP with PV can enable additional PV deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system. This theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems.

These systems, often found on islands, have shown success in reducing diesel consumption by significant percentages. However, financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and may vary based on the power plant's ownership structure. Additionally, deploying distributed networks of PV+CHP hybrid systems has demonstrated increased PV penetration limits in the U.S., enabling additional PV deployment while providing backup for intermittent PV and reducing CHP runtime with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems."

        "text": "In 2019, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 47.1% was achieved by using multi-junction concentrator solar cells, developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado, US. [141] The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by Sharp Corporation at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009, [142] and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate band gap that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (\u03b7>30%) [143] are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (\u03b7>20%). Recent developments in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s. [144] To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges 6.7\u20138.94% for small molecule, 8.4\u201310.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7\u201321% for perovskite OPVs. [145] [146] OPVs are expected to play a major role in the PV market. Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable. Several companies have begun embedding power optimizers into PV modules called smart modules . These modules perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease. [147] One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from silica , and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the solar cells , but reflects infrared rays (which carry heat). [148]",

Standalone systems vary widely in size and application from wristwatches or calculators to remote buildings or spacecraft . If the load is to be supplied independently of solar insolation , the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery. [119] In non-portable applications where weight is not an issue, such as in buildings, lead acid batteries are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse. A charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging. It may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique ( MPPT ). However, in simple PV systems where the PV module voltage is matched to the battery voltage, the use of MPPT electronics is generally considered unnecessary, since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the PV module.\nIn small devices (e.g. calculators, parking meters) only direct current (DC) is consumed. In larger systems (e.g. buildings, remote water pumps) AC is usually required. To convert the DC from the modules or batteries into AC, an inverter is used. In agricultural settings, the array may be used to directly power DC pumps , without the need for an inverter . In remote settings such as mountainous areas, islands, or other places where a power grid is unavailable, solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity, usually by charging a storage battery . Stand-alone systems closely relate to microgeneration and distributed generation .",

[83] Although wholesale module prices remained flat at around $3.50 to $4.00/W in the early 2000s due to high demand in Germany and Spain afforded by generous subsidies and shortage of polysilicon, demand crashed with the abrupt ending of Spanish subsidies after the market crash of 2008, and the price dropped rapidly to $2.00/W. Manufacturers were able to maintain a positive operating margin despite a 50% drop in income due to innovation and reductions in costs. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules suddenly dropped below the $1.00/W mark, taking many in the industry by surprise, and has caused a number of solar manufacturing companies to go bankrupt throughout the world. The $1.00/W cost is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV, but most experts do not believe this price point is sustainable. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, may mean that further price reductions are possible. [3] The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011. [84] In 2013 wholesale prices had fallen to $0.74/W. [83] This has been cited as evidence supporting ' Swanson's law ', an observation similar to the famous Moore's Law , which claims that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity. [83] The Fraunhofer Institute defines the 'learning rate' as the drop in prices as the cumulative production doubles, some 25% between 1980 and 2010. Although the prices for modules have dropped quickly, current inverter prices have dropped at a much lower rate, and in 2019 constitute over 61% of the cost per kWp, from a quarter in the early 2000s. [55] Note that the prices mentioned above are for bare modules, another way of looking at module prices is to include installation costs. In the US, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the price of installed rooftop PV modules for homeowners fell from $9.00/W in 2006 to $5.46/W in 2011. Including the prices paid by industrial installations, the national installed price drops to $3.45/W. This is markedly higher than elsewhere in the world, in Germany homeowner rooftop installations averaged at $2.24/W. The cost differences are thought to be primarily based on the higher regulatory burden and lack of a national solar policy in the US. [85] By the end of 2012 Chinese manufacturers had production costs of $0.50/W in the cheapest modules. [86] In some markets distributors of these modules can earn a considerable margin, buying at factory-gate price and selling at the highest price the market can support ('value-based pricing'). [3] In California PV reached grid parity in 2011, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). [87] Grid parity had been reached in 19 markets in 2014. [88] [89]",

[28] Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically chaotic , and may eventually be disrupted . There is a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next few billion years. Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today. [29] The Sun's main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10\u00a0billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other subsequent phases of the Sun's pre- remnant life combined. [30] The Solar System will remain roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5\u00a0billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At that time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant . Because of its increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be cooler (2,600\u00a0K (4,220\u00a0\u00b0F) at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. [30] The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable (possibly destroying it as well). [31] Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf , half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. [30] The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula , returning some of the material that formed the Sun\u2014but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon\u2014to the interstellar medium .

This expansion will lead to the vaporization of Mercury and Venus, rendering Earth uninhabitable.

        "text": "For behind-the-meter rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes two-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid, allowing for net metering . However, electricity networks traditionally are not designed to deal with two-way energy transfer, which may introduce technical issues. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network. [162] There are solutions to manage the over-voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions. High generation during the middle of the day reduces the net generation demand, but higher peak net demand as the sun goes down can require rapid ramping of utility generating stations, producing a load profile called the duck curve . There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charges when electricity prices are reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example in residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economic decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematic evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.

        "text": "The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is the cost per kWh based on the costs distributed over the project lifetime, and is thought to be a better metric for calculating viability than price per wattage. LCOEs vary dramatically depending on the location. [3] The LCOE can be considered the minimum price customers will have to pay the utility company in order for it to break even on the investment in a new power station. [5] Grid parity is roughly achieved when the LCOE falls to a similar price as conventional local grid prices, although in actuality the calculations are not directly comparable. [90] Large industrial PV installations had reached grid parity in California in 2011. [80] [90] Grid parity for rooftop systems was still believed to be much farther away at this time. [90] Many LCOE calculations are not thought to be accurate, and a large amount of assumptions are required. [3] [90] Module prices may drop further, and the LCOE for solar may correspondingly drop in the future. [91] Because energy demands rise and fall over the course of the day, and solar power is limited by the fact that the sun sets, solar power companies must also factor in the additional costs of supplying a more stable alternative energy supplies to the grid in order to stabilize the system, or storing the energy somehow (current battery technology cannot store enough power). These costs are not factored into LCOE calculations, nor are special subsidies or premiums that may make buying solar power more attractive. [5] The unreliability and temporal variation in generation of solar and wind power is a major problem. Too much of these volatile power sources can cause instability of the entire grid. [92] As of 2017 power-purchase agreement prices for solar farms below $0.05/kWh are common in the United States, and the lowest bids in some Persian Gulf countries were about $0.03/kWh. [93] The goal of the United States Department of Energy is to achieve a levelised cost of energy for solar PV of $0.03/kWh for utility companies. [94]",

This metric provides a better understanding of the minimum price customers need to pay the utility company for the power station to break even on its investment. LCOEs vary based on location and help assess grid parity, where solar power's LCOE matches conventional grid prices. Factors like energy demand fluctuations, limited solar power due to sunset, additional stabilization costs, and evolving technology impact LCOE calculations. Achieving lower LCOEs, such as the U.S. DOE's goal of $0.03/kWh for solar PV, is essential for enhancing the competitiveness of solar energy."

        "text": "The Solar System formed at least 4.568\u00a0billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud . [b] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. [14] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. [15] As the pre-solar nebula [15] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surroundings. [14] As the contracting nebula spun faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200\u00a0AU [14] [16] and a hot, dense protostar at the center. [17] [18] The planets formed by accretion from this disc, [19] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies . [20] [21] Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun (within the frost line ). They would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because these refractory materials only comprised a small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. [20] The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. [20] Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. [20] Within 50\u00a0million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion . [22] As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; [23] early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today. [24] The temperature, reaction rate , pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. [25] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space. [23] Following the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk , the Nice model proposes that gravitational encounters between planetisimals and the gas giants caused each to migrate into different orbits. This led to dynamical instability of the entire system, which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately placed the gas giants in their current positions. During this period, the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward migration of Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid belt, leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner planets.
