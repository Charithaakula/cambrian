        "text": "The main appeal of BECCS is in its ability to result in negative emissions of CO 2 . The capture of carbon dioxide from bioenergy sources effectively removes CO 2 from the atmosphere. [8] [9] Bioenergy is derived from biomass which is a renewable energy source and serves as a carbon sink during its growth. During industrial processes, the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the CO 2 into the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology serves to intercept the release of CO 2 into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations, [10] [11] or concrete. [12] [13] The process thus results in a net zero emission of CO 2 , though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth, transport and processing, see below under environmental considerations. [14] CO 2 with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants, but also during the production of pulp used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as biogas and bioethanol . The BECCS technology can also be employed on industrial processes such as these [15] and making cement. [16] BECCS technologies trap carbon dioxide in geologic formations in a semi-permanent way, whereas a tree stores its carbon only during its lifetime. In 2005 it was estimated that more than 99% of carbon dioxide stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years. [17] In 2005, the IPCC estimated that BECCS technology would provide a \"better permanence\" by storing CO 2 in geological formations underground, relative to other types of carbon sinks. Carbon sinks such as the ocean, trees, and soil involve a risk of adverse climate change feedback at increased temperatures. [18] [17] Industrial processes have released too much CO 2 to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil to reach low emission targets. [19] In addition to the presently accumulated emissions, there will be significant additional emissions during this century, even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios. BECCS has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions. [1] [20] [19] [21] [22] This implies that the emissions would not only be zero, but negative, so that not only the emissions, but the absolute amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere would be reduced.",

In oxy‐fuel combustion, the main difference from conventional air firing is that the fuel is burned in a mixture of O 2 and recycled flue gas. The O 2 is produced by an air separation unit (ASU), which removes the atmospheric N 2 from the oxidizer stream. By removing the N 2 upstream of the process, a flue gas with a high concentration of CO 2 and water vapor is produced, which eliminates the need for a post‐combustion capture plant. The water vapor can be removed by condensation, leaving a product stream of relatively high‐purity CO 2 which, after subsequent purification and dehydration, can be pumped to a geological storage site. [27] Key challenges of BECCS implementation using oxy-combustion are associated with the combustion process. For the high volatile content biomass, the mill temperature has to be kept at a low temperature to reduce the risk of fire and explosion. In addition, the flame temperature is lower. Therefore, the concentration of oxygen needs to be increased up to 27-30%. [27]",

The most important by-products are wood residues, agricultural residues and municipal/industrial waste: Wood residues are by-products from forestry operations or from the wood processing industry. Had the residues not been collected and used for bioenergy, they would have decayed (and therefore produced emissions) [g] on the forest floor or in landfills, or been burnt (and produced emissions) at the side of the road in forests or outside wood processing facilities. [24] The by-products from forestry operations are called logging residues or forest residues, and consist of tree tops, branches, stumps, damaged or dying or dead trees, irregular or bent stem sections, thinnings (small trees that are cleared away in order to help the bigger trees grow large), and trees removed to reduce wildfire risk. [h] The extraction level of logging residues differ from region to region, [i] [j] but there is an increasing interest in using this feedstock, [k] since the sustainable potential is large (15 EJ annually). [l] 68% of the total forest biomass in the EU consists of wood stems, and 32% consists of stumps, branches and tops. [25] The by-products from the wood processing industry are called wood processing residues and consist of cut offs, shavings, sawdust, bark, and black liquor. [26] Wood processing residues have a total energy content of 5.5 EJ annually. [27] Wood pellets are mainly made from wood processing residues, [m] and have a total energy content of 0.7 EJ.

[aq] Short carbon payback/parity times are produced when the most realistic no-bioenergy scenario is a traditional forestry scenario where \"good\" wood stems are harvested for lumber production, and residues are burned or left behind in the forest or in landfills. The collection of such residues provides material which \"[...] would have released its carbon (via decay or burning) back to the atmosphere anyway (over time spans defined by the biome's decay rate) [...].\" [63] In other words, payback and parity times depend on the decay speed. The decay speed depends on a.) location (because decay speed is \"[...] roughly proportional to temperature and rainfall [...]\" [64] ), and b.) the thickness of the residues. [ar] Residues decay faster in warm and wet areas, and thin residues decay faster than thick residues. Thin residues in warm and wet temperate forests therefore have the fastest decay, while thick residues in cold and dry boreal forests have the slowest decay. If the residues instead are burned in the no-bioenergy scenario, e.g. outside the factories or at roadside in the forests, emissions are instant. In this case, parity times approach zero. [as] Like other scientists, the JRC staff note the high variability in carbon accounting results, and attribute this to different methodologies. [at] In the studies examined, the JRC found carbon parity times of 0 to 400 years for stemwood harvested exclusively for bioenergy, depending on different characteristics and assumptions for both the forest/bioenergy system and the alternative fossil system, with the emission intensity of the displaced fossil fuels seen as the most important factor, followed by conversion efficiency and biomass growth rate/rotation time. Other factors relevant for the carbon parity time are the initial carbon stock and the existing harvest level; both higher initial carbon stock and higher harvest level means longer parity times. [65] Liquid biofuels have high parity times because about half of the energy content of the biomass is lost in the processing. [au]",

        "text": "EU's Joint Research Centre has examined a number of bioenergy emission estimates found in literature, and calculated greenhouse gas savings percentages for bioenergy pathways in heat production, transportation fuel production and electricity production, based on those studies. The calculations are based on the attributional LCA accounting principle. It includes all supply chain emissions, from raw material extraction, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to end-of-life treatment and final disposal. It also includes emissions related to the production of the fossil fuels used in the supply chain. It excludes emission/absorption effects that takes place outside its system boundaries, for instance market related, biogeophysical (e.g. albedo), and time-dependent effects. The authors conclude that \"[m]ost bio-based commodities release less GHG than fossil products along their supply chain; but the magnitude of GHG emissions vary greatly with logistics, type of feedstocks, land and ecosystem management, resource efficiency, and technology.\" [67] Because of the varied climate mitigation potential for different biofuel pathways, governments and organizations set up different certification schemes to ensure that biomass use is sustainable, for instance the RED (Renewable Energy Directive) in the EU and the ISO standard 13065 by the International Organization for Standardization. [68] In the US, the RFS (Renewables Fuel Standard) limit the use of traditional biofuels and defines the minimum life-cycle GHG emissions that are acceptable. Biofuels are considered traditional if they achieve up to 20% GHG emission reduction compared to the petrochemical equivalent, advanced if they save at least 50%, and cellulosic if the save more than 60%. [av] The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) states that the typical greenhouse gas emissions savings when replacing fossil fuels with wood pellets from forest residues for heat production varies between 69% and 77%, depending on transport distance: When the distance is between 0 and 2500 km, emission savings is 77%. Emission savings drop to 75% when the distance is between 2500 and 10 000 km, and to 69% when the distance is above 10 000 km. When stemwood is used, emission savings varies between 70% and 77%, depending on transport distance. When wood industry residues are used, savings varies between 79% and 87%. [aw] Since the long payback and parity times calculated for some forestry projects is seen as a non-issue for energy crops (except in the cases mentioned above), researchers instead calculate static climate mitigation potentials for these crops, using LCA-based carbon accounting methods. A particular energy crop-based bioenergy project is considered carbon positive, carbon neutral or carbon negative based on the total amount of CO 2 equivalent emissions and absorptions accumulated throughout its entire lifetime: If emissions during agriculture, processing, transport and combustion are higher than what is absorbed (and stored) by the plants, both above and below ground, during the project's lifetime, the project is carbon positive. Likewise, if total absorption is higher than total emissions, the project is carbon negative. In other words, carbon negativity is possible when net carbon accumulation more than compensates for net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO 2 . [ax] [62] : 393 There is now (2018) consensus in the scientific community that \"[...] the GHG [greenhouse gas] balance of perennial bioenergy crop cultivation will often be favourable [...]\", also when considering the implicit direct and indirect land use changes.

[60] : 3 There is also a loss of soil carbon due to the harvest operations. [60] : 3 Old trees absorb more CO 2 than young trees, because of the larger leaf area in full grown trees. [73] However, the old forest (as a whole) will eventually stop absorbing CO 2 because CO 2 emissions from dead trees cancel out the remaining living trees' CO 2 absorption. [ay] The old forest (or forest stands) are also vulnerable for natural disturbances that produces CO 2 . The IPCC found that \"[...] landscapes with older forests have accumulated more carbon but their sink strength is diminishing, while landscapes with younger forests contain less carbon but they are removing CO 2 from the atmosphere at a much higher rate [...].\" [62] : 386 The IPCC states that the net climate effect from conversion of unmanaged to managed forest can be positive or negative, depending on circumstances. The carbon stock is reduced , but since managed forests grow faster than unmanaged forests, more carbon is absorbed . Positive climate effects are produced if the harvested biomass is used efficiently. [62] : 351 There is a tradeoff between the benefits of having a maximized forest carbon stock, not absorbing any more carbon, and the benefits of having a portion of that carbon stock \"unlocked\", and instead working as a renewable fossil fuel replacement tool, for instance in sectors which are difficult or expensive to decarbonize. [31] [az] The \"competition\" between locked-away and unlocked forest carbon might be won by the unlocked carbon: \"In the long term, using sustainably produced forest biomass as a substitute for carbon-intensive products and fossil fuels provides greater permanent reductions in atmospheric CO 2 than preservation does.\" [74] : 39 IEA Bioenergy writes: \"forests managed for producing sawn timber, bioenergy and other wood products can make a greater contribution to climate change mitigation than forests managed for conservation alone.\" Three reasons are given: [75] Data from FAO show that most wood pellets are produced in regions dominated by sustainably managed forests, such as Europe and North America. Europe (including Russia) produced 54% of the world's wood pellets in 2019, and the forest carbon stock in this area increased from 158.7 to 172.4 Gt between 1990 and 2020. In the EU, above-ground forest biomass increases with 1.3% per year on average, however the increase is slowing down because the forests are maturing. [76] United Kingdom Emissions Trading System allows operators of CO2 generating installations to apply zero emissions factor for the fraction used for non-energy purposes, while energy purposes (electricity generation, heating) require additional sustainability certification on the biomass used.

Therefore, they play an important role in climate change mitigation .

Throughout their lifespan, trees continue to sequester carbon, storing atmospheric CO 2 long-term. [18] Sustainable forest management , afforestation , reforestation are therefore important contributions to climate change mitigation. An important consideration in such efforts is that forests can turn from sinks to carbon sources. [19] [20] [21] In 2019 forests took up a third less carbon than they did in the 1990s, due to higher temperatures, droughts and deforestation . The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the 2060s. [22] Researchers have found that, in terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to allow for deforestation to subsequently reforest, as the former leads to irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation . [23] Furthermore, the probability that legacy carbon will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest. [24] Global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests may have been substantially underestimated until around 2019. [25] Additionally, the effects of af- or reforestation will be farther in the future than keeping existing forests intact. [26] It takes much longer − several decades − for the benefits for global warming to manifest to the same carbon sequestration benefits from mature trees in tropical forests and hence from limiting deforestation. [27] Therefore, scientists consider \"the protection and recovery of carbon-rich and long-lived ecosystems, especially natural forests\" to be \"the major climate solution \". [28] The planting of trees on marginal crop and pasture lands helps to incorporate carbon from atmospheric CO 2 into biomass . [29] [30] For this carbon sequestration process to succeed the carbon must not return to the atmosphere from biomass burning or rotting when the trees die. [31] To this end, land allotted to the trees must not be converted to other uses. Alternatively, the wood from them must itself be sequestered, e.g., via biochar , bioenergy with carbon capture and storage , landfill or stored by use in construction. Earth offers enough room to plant an additional 1.2 trillion trees. [32] [ obsolete source ] Planting and protecting them would offset some 10 years of CO 2 emissions and sequester 205 billion tons of carbon. [33] This approach is supported by the Trillion Tree Campaign . Restoring all degraded forests world-wide would capture about 205 billion tons of carbon in total, which is [ when? ] about two-thirds of all carbon emissions. [34] [35] Life expectancy of forests varies throughout the world, influenced by tree species, site conditions, and natural disturbance patterns. In some forests, carbon may be stored for centuries, while in other forests, carbon is released with frequent stand replacing fires. Forests that are harvested prior to stand replacing events allow for the retention of carbon in manufactured forest products such as lumber . [36] However, only a portion of the carbon removed from logged forests ends up as durable goods and buildings. The remainder ends up as sawmill by-products such as pulp, paper, and pallets. [37] If all new construction globally utilized 90% wood products, largely via adoption of mass timber in low rise construction, this could sequester 700 million net tons of carbon per year. [38] [39] This is in addition to the elimination of carbon emissions from the displaced construction material such as steel or concrete, which are carbon-intense to produce. A meta-analysis found that mixed species plantations would increase carbon storage alongside other benefits of diversifying planted forests. [6] Although a bamboo forest stores less total carbon than a mature forest of trees, a bamboo plantation sequesters carbon at a much faster rate than a mature forest or a tree plantation. Therefore, the farming of bamboo timber may have significant carbon sequestration potential. [40] The Food and Agriculure Organization (FAO) reported that: \"The total carbon stock in forests decreased from 668 gigatonnes in 1990 to 662 gigatonnes in 2020\". [16] : 11 In Canada's boreal forests as much as 80% of the total carbon is stored in the soils as dead organic matter. [41] [ globalize ] Carbon offset programs are planting millions of fast-growing trees per year to reforest tropical lands. [ citation needed ] Over their typical 40-year lifetime, one million of these trees can sequester up to one million tons of carbon dioxide. [42] [43] The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report says: \"Secondary forest regrowth and restoration of degraded forests and non-forest ecosystems can play a large role in carbon sequestration (high confidence) with high resilience to disturbances and additional benefits such as enhanced biodiversity.\" [44] [45] At the beginning of the 21st century, interest in reforestation grew over its potential to mitigate climate change. Even without displacing agriculture and cities, earth can [ clarification needed ] sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early 20th century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050 because some tropical areas will become too hot. [46] The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: Russia , Canada , Brazil , Australia , the United States and China . [47] Impacts on temperature are affected by the location of the forest. For example, reforestation in boreal or subarctic regions has less impact on climate. This is because it substitutes a high- albedo , snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of clouds . These clouds then reflect the sunlight , lowering temperatures. [48] : 1457 Planting trees in tropical climates with wet seasons has another advantage. In such a setting, trees grow more quickly (fixing more carbon) because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the girth of 70,000 trees across Africa has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one-fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across Africa, Amazonia and Asia . Simon Lewis stated, \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.\" [49] [ obsolete source ] A 2019 study of the global potential for tree restoration showed that there is space for at least 9 million km 2 of new forests worldwide, which is a 25% increase from current conditions. [50] This forested area could store up to 205 gigatons of carbon or 25% of the atmosphere's current carbon pool by reducing CO 2 in the atmosphere. [50]",

        "text": "Wetland restoration involves restoring a wetland's natural biological, geological, and chemical functions through re-establishment or rehabilitation. [52] It is a good way to reduce climate change. [53] Wetland soil, particularly in coastal wetlands such as mangroves , sea grasses , and salt marshes , [53] is an important carbon reservoir; 20–30% of the world's soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5–8% of the world's land is composed of wetlands. [54] Studies have shown that restored wetlands can become productive CO 2 sinks [55] [56] [57] and many are being restored. [58] [59] Aside from climate benefits, wetland restoration and conservation can help preserve biodiversity, improve water quality , and aid with flood control . [60] The plants that makeup wetlands absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere and convert it into organic matter. The waterlogged nature of the soil slows down the decomposition of organic material, leading to the accumulation of carbon-rich peat, [ clarification needed ] acting as a long-term carbon sink . [61] Also, anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils hinder the complete breakdown of organic matter, promoting the conversion of carbon into more stable forms. [61] [ needs copy edit ] As with forests, for the sequestration process to succeed, the wetland must remain undisturbed. If it is disturbed the carbon stored in the plants and sediments will be released back into the atmosphere, and the ecosystem will no longer function as a carbon sink. [62] Additionally, some wetlands can release non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, such as methane [63] and nitrous oxide [64] which could offset potential climate benefits. The amounts of carbon sequestered via blue carbon by wetlands can also be difficult to measure. [60] Wetland soil is an important carbon sink ; 14.5% of the world's soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5.5% of the world's land is composed of wetlands. [65] Not only are wetlands a great carbon sink, they have many other benefits like collecting floodwater, filtering out air and water pollutants, and creating a home for numerous birds, fish, insects, and plants. [66] Climate change could alter wetland soil carbon storage, changing it from a sink to a source. [67] [ obsolete source ] With rising temperatures comes an increase in greenhouse gasses from wetlands especially locations with permafrost . When this permafrost melts it increases the available oxygen and water in the soil. [67] Because of this, bacteria in the soil would create large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to be released into the atmosphere. [67] [ obsolete source ] The link between climate change and wetlands is still not fully known. [67] [ obsolete source ] It is also not clear how restored wetlands manage carbon while still being a contributing source of methane. However, preserving these areas would help prevent further release of carbon into the atmosphere. [68]",

        "text": "Compared to natural vegetation, cropland soils are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC). When soil is converted from natural land or semi-natural land, such as forests, woodlands, grasslands, steppes, and savannas, the SOC content in the soil reduces by about 30–40%. [71] This loss is due to harvesting , as plants contain carbon. When land use changes , the carbon in the soil will either increase or decrease, and this change will continue until the soil reaches a new equilibrium. Deviations from this equilibrium can also be affected by variated [ clarification needed ] climate. [72] The decreasing of SOC content can be counteracted by increasing the carbon input. This can be done with several strategies, e.g. leave harvest residues on the field, use manure as fertilizer, or include perennial crops in the rotation. Perennial crops have a larger below-ground biomass fraction, which increases the SOC content. [71] Perennial crops reduce the need for tillage and thus help mitigate soil erosion, and may help increase soil organic matter. Globally, soils are estimated to contain >8,580 gigatons of organic carbon, about ten times the amount in the atmosphere and much more than in vegetation. [73] Researchers have found that rising temperatures can lead to population booms in soil microbes, converting stored carbon into carbon dioxide. In laboratory experiments heating soil, fungi-rich soils released less carbon dioxide than other soils. [74] Following carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) absorption from the atmosphere, plants deposit organic matter into the soil. [75] This organic matter, derived from decaying plant material and root systems, is rich in carbon compounds. Microorganisms in the soil break down this organic matter, and in the process, some of the carbon becomes further stabilized in the soil as humus - a process known as humification . [76] On a global basis, it is estimated that soil contains about 2,500 gigatons of carbon. [ contradictory ] This is greater than 3-fold the carbon found in the atmosphere and 4-fold of that found in living plants and animals. [77] About 70% of the global soil organic carbon in non-permafrost areas is found in the deeper soil within the upper metre and is stabilized by mineral-organic associations. [78]",

This is a nature-based solution and methods being trialled include the use of \"wood vaults\" to store the wood-containing carbon under oxygen-free conditions.

        "text": "Seaweed grow in shallow and coastal areas, and capture significant amounts of carbon that can be transported to the deep ocean by oceanic mechanisms; seaweed reaching the deep ocean sequester carbon and prevent it from exchanging with the atmosphere over millennia. [136] Growing seaweed offshore with the purpose of sinking the seaweed in the depths of the sea to sequester carbon has been suggested. [137] In addition, seaweed grows very fast and can theoretically be harvested and processed to generate biomethane , via anaerobic digestion to generate electricity, via cogeneration/CHP or as a replacement for natural gas . One study suggested that if seaweed farms covered 9% of the ocean they could produce enough biomethane to supply Earth's equivalent demand for fossil fuel energy, remove 53 gigatonnes of CO 2 per year from the atmosphere and sustainably produce 200 kg per year of fish, per person, for 10 billion people. [138] [ obsolete source ] Ideal species for such farming and conversion include Laminaria digitata , Fucus serratus and Saccharina latissima . [139] Both macroalgae and microalgae are being investigated as possible means of carbon sequestration. [140] [141] Marine phytoplankton perform half of the global photosynthetic CO 2 fixation (net global primary production of ~50 Pg C per year) and half of the oxygen production despite amounting to only ~1% of global plant biomass. [142] Because algae lack the complex lignin associated with terrestrial plants , the carbon in algae is released into the atmosphere more rapidly than carbon captured on land. [140] [143] Algae have been proposed as a short-term storage pool of carbon that can be used as a feedstock for the production of various biogenic fuels. [144] Large-scale seaweed farming could sequester huge amounts of carbon. [145] Wild seaweed will sequester large amount of carbon through dissolved particles of organic matter being transported to deep ocean seafloors where it will become buried and remain for long periods of time. [146] Currently seaweed farming is carried out to provide food, medicine and biofuel. [146] In respect to carbon farming, the potential growth of seaweed for carbon farming would see the harvested seaweed transported to the deep ocean for long-term burial. [146] Seaweed farming has gathered attention given the limited terrestrial space available for carbon farming practices. [146] Currently seaweed farming occurs mostly in the Asian Pacific coastal areas where it has been a rapidly increasing market. [146] The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate recommends \"further research attention\" on seaweed farming as a mitigation tactic. [147] However, seaweed farming, and carbon farming in general,  only keeps the carbon within the fast carbon cycle, in intimate contact with the ocean and atmosphere, and once in equilibrium with the ecology, cannot be expected to hold additional carbon.",

[17] Anthropogenic carbon emissions exceed the amount that can be taken up or balanced out by natural sinks. [41] Thus carbon dioxide has gradually accumulated in the atmosphere and, as of May 2022, its concentration is 50% above pre-industrial levels. [1] The extraction and burning of fossil fuels, releasing carbon that has been underground for many millions of years, has increased the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 . [3] [12] As of year 2019 the extraction and burning of geologic fossil carbon by humans releases over 30 gigatonnes of CO 2 (9 billion tonnes carbon) each year. [42] This larger disruption to the natural balance is responsible for recent growth in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. [30] [43] Currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere . [44] Burning fossil fuels such as coal , petroleum , and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO 2 ; deforestation is the second major cause. In 2010, 9.14 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC, equivalent to 33.5 gigatonnes of CO 2 or about 4.3 ppm in Earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to 6.15 GtC in 1990. [45] In addition, land use change contributed 0.87 GtC in 2010, compared to 1.45 GtC in 1990. [45] In the period 1751 to 1900, about 12 GtC were released as CO 2 to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from 1901 to 2013 the figure was about 380 GtC. [46] The International Energy Agency estimates that the top 1% of emitters globally each had carbon footprints of over 50 tonnes of CO 2 in 2021, more than 1,000 times greater than those of the bottom 1% of emitters. The global average energy-related carbon footprint is around 4.7 tonnes of CO 2 per person. [47]",

The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. [48] [49] [50] Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be about −18 °C (−0.4 °F) [51] [52] compared to Earth's actual average surface temperature of approximately 14 °C (57.2 °F). [53] Water is responsible for most (about 36–70%) of the total greenhouse effect, and the role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas depends on temperature. On Earth, carbon dioxide is the most relevant, direct anthropologically influenced greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is often mentioned in the context of its increased influence as a greenhouse gas since the pre-industrial (1750) era. In 2013, the increase in CO 2 was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W m −2 of the 2.63 W m −2 change in radiative forcing on Earth (about 70%). [54] The concept of atmospheric CO 2 increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. [55] The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO 2 in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO 2 and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO 2 absorbs outgoing long-wave energy.  The increased forcing drives further changes in Earth's energy balance and, over the longer term, in Earth's climate. [17]",

        "text": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby CO 2 is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates , to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on Earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle. The fast carbon cycle refers to movements of carbon between the environment and living things in the biosphere whereas the slow carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, rocks, and volcanism. Both cycles are intrinsically interconnected and atmospheric CO 2 facilitates the linkage. Natural sources of atmospheric CO 2 include volcanic outgassing , the combustion of organic matter , wildfires and the respiration processes of living aerobic organisms . Man-made sources of CO 2 include the burning of fossil fuels for heating, power generation and transport , as well as some industrial processes such as cement making. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration . Plants , algae and cyanobacteria convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by a process called photosynthesis. They gain the energy needed for this reaction from absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and other pigments. Oxygen, produced as a by-product of photosynthesis, is released into the atmosphere and subsequently used for respiration by heterotrophic organisms and other plants, forming a cycle with carbon. Most sources of CO 2 emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by similar CO 2 sinks. For example, the decay of organic material in forests, grasslands, and other land vegetation - including forest fires - results in the release of about 436 gigatonnes of CO 2 (containing 119 gigatonnes carbon) every year, while CO 2 uptake by new growth on land counteracts these releases, absorbing 451 Gt (123 Gt C). [57] Although much CO 2 in the early atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity , modern volcanic activity releases only 130 to 230 megatonnes of CO 2 each year. [58] Natural sources are more or less balanced by natural sinks, in the form of chemical and biological processes which remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. Overall, there is a large natural flux of atmospheric CO 2 into and out of the biosphere , both on land and in the oceans. [59] In the pre-industrial era, each of  these fluxes were in balance to such a degree that little net CO 2 flowed between the land and ocean reservoirs of carbon, and little change resulted in the atmospheric concentration.  From the human pre-industrial era to 1940, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO 2 (driven largely by land-use changes ), but subsequently switched to a net sink with growing fossil carbon emissions. [60] In 2012, about 57% of human-emitted CO 2 , mostly from the burning of fossil carbon, was taken up by land and ocean sinks. [61] [60] The ratio of the increase in atmospheric CO 2 to emitted CO 2 is known as the airborne fraction . This ratio varies in the short-term and is typically about 45% over longer (5-year) periods. [60] Estimated carbon in global terrestrial vegetation increased from approximately 740 gigatonnes in 1910 to 780 gigatonnes in 1990. [62]",

The bicarbonate is produced in reactions between rock, water, and carbon dioxide. Adding CO 2 to the atmosphere and thus to seawater decreases the pH of seawater, a process which has been termed ocean acidification (pH of the ocean becomes more acidic although the pH value remains in the alkaline range). From 1850 until 2022, the ocean has absorbed 26% of total anthropogenic emissions. [12] However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain. Even if equilibrium is reached, including dissolution of carbonate minerals, the increased concentration of bicarbonate and decreased or unchanged concentration of carbonate ion will give rise to a higher concentration of un-ionized carbonic acid and dissolved CO 2 . This higher concentration in the seas, along with higher temperatures, would mean a higher equilibrium concentration of CO 2 in the air.

[10] However the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimated similar levels 3 to 3.3 million years ago in the mid-Pliocene warm period . This period can be a proxy for likely climate outcomes with current levels of CO 2 . [116] : Figure 2.34 Carbon dioxide is believed to have played an important effect in regulating Earth's temperature throughout its 4.54 billion year history. Early in the Earth's life, scientists have found evidence of liquid water indicating a warm world even though the Sun's output is believed to have only been 70% of what it is today. Higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Earth's atmosphere might help explain this faint young sun paradox . When Earth first formed, Earth's atmosphere may have contained more greenhouse gases and CO 2 concentrations may have been higher, with estimated partial pressure as large as 1,000 kPa (10 bar ), because there was no bacterial photosynthesis to reduce the gas to carbon compounds and oxygen. Methane , a very active greenhouse gas, may have been more prevalent as well. [117] [118] Carbon dioxide concentrations have shown several cycles of variation from about 180 parts per million during the deep glaciations of the Holocene and Pleistocene to 280 parts per million during the interglacial periods. Carbon dioxide concentrations have varied widely over the Earth's history. It is believed to have been present in Earth's first atmosphere, shortly after Earth's formation. The second atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen and CO 2 was produced by outgassing from volcanism , supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids . [119] A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and incorporated in carbonate sediments. The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere (the modern atmosphere) 2.4 billion years ago. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from 4,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million 20,000 years ago . [2]",

        "section": "Measuring ancient-Earth CO2 concentration",
        "text": "The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before instrumental sampling is to measure bubbles of air ( fluid or gas inclusions ) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were about 260–280 ppm immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years . [125] [126] The longest ice core record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of 800,000 years. [127] During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180 and 210 ppm during ice ages , increasing to 280–300 ppm during warmer interglacials . [128] [129] CO 2 mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by around 35 percent since the 1900s, rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009. One study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability, with CO 2 mole fractions above 300 ppm during the period ten to seven thousand years ago, [130] though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual CO 2 variability. [131] [132] Because of the way air is trapped in ice (pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn ) and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed, these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels. Ice cores provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years. Both CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations vary between glacial and interglacial phases, and these variations correlate strongly with temperature. Direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record, a record that indicates that CO 2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180 ppm to 280 ppm throughout the last 800,000 years, until the increase of the last 250 years. However, various proxy measurements and models suggest larger variations in past epochs: 500 million years ago CO 2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now. [133] Various proxy measurements have been used to try to determine atmospheric CO 2 concentrations millions of years in the past. These include boron and carbon isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the numbers of stomata observed on fossil plant leaves. [122] Phytane is a type of diterpenoid alkane . It is a breakdown product of chlorophyll, and is now used to estimate ancient CO 2 levels. [134] Phytane gives both a continuous record of CO 2 concentrations but it also can overlap a break in the CO 2 record of over 500 million years. [134]",

There are a number of different types of LULUCF projects. Forestry-related projects focus on avoiding deforestation. They do this by protecting existing forests, restoring forests on land that was once forested, and creating forests [94] on land that previously had no forests, typically for more than a generation. Soil management projects attempt to preserve or increase the amount of carbon sequestered in soil. Deforestation is particularly significant in Brazil, Indonesia, and parts of Africa. It accounts for about 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. [95] It is possible to avoid deforestation by paying directly for forest preservation. Another way is to use offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products. REDD is a framework to encourage developing countries to reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases through a variety of forest management options, and to provide technical and financial support for these efforts. REDD credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests. They also provide a mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to help  developing nations with the protection of native forests. Offset schemes using reforestation are available in developing countries. They are increasingly available in developed countries including the US and the UK. [96] [97] Soil is one of the important aspects of agriculture and can affect the amount of yield in the crops. Modern agriculture has caused a decrease in the amount of carbon that the soil is able to hold. [98] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through various practices. These include the use of winter cover crops , reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage , and using compost and manure as soil amendments. [99]",

It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. [30] Electronically controlled ' common rail ' and ' Unit Injector ' type systems from the late 1990s onwards can only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are designed to run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the fuel rail design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, engine filters may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO x -emissions [31] Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable , and has a high flash point of about 300 °F (148 °C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125 °F (52 °C). [32] In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. [33] [34] In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. [35] Avril Group produces under the brand Diester , a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union . [36] It is the leading European producer of biodiesel. [35]",

[52] They also enhance engine performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions . By greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions, they contribute to improved air quality. [53] [54] In transportation fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), methyl tert -butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert -butyl ether (ETBE), tert -amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tert -amyl ethyl ether (TAEE). [55] The European Fuel Oxygenates Association identifies MTBE and ETBE as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. [56] Although Europeans still use bioether additives, the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 lifted a requirement for reformulated gasoline to include an oxygenate, leading to less MTBE being added to fuel. [57] Although bioethers are likely to replace ethers produced from petroleum in the UK, it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density. [58]",

        "section": "Environmental impacts",
        "text": "Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined. [6] In general, biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon they emit has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in biofuel production. [5] They can have greenhouse gas emissions ranging from as low as -127.1 gCO2eq per MJ when carbon capture is incorporated into their production to those exceeding 95 gCO2eq per MJ when land-use change is significant. [40] [41] Several factors are responsible for the variation in emission numbers of biofuel such as feedstock and its origin, fuel production technique, system boundary definitions, and energy sources. [41] However, many government policies such as those by European Union and the UK require that biofuels have at least 65% greenhouse gas emissions savings (or 70% if it is renewable fuels of non-biological origins) relative to fossil fuels. [93] [94] Life-cycle assessments of first generation biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks. [6] [7] If no land-use change is involved, first-generation biofuels can—on average—have lower emissions than fossil fuels. [6] However, biofuel production can compete with foodcrop production. Up to 40% of corn produced in the United States is used to make ethanol [95] and worldwide 10% of all grain is turned into biofuel. [96] A 50% reduction in grain used for biofuels in the US and Europe would replace all of Ukraine 's grain exports. [97] Several studies have shown that reductions in emissions from biofuels are achieved at the expense of other impacts, such as acidification , eutrophication , water footprint and biodiversity loss . [6] The use of second generation biofuels is thought to increase environmental sustainability, since the non-food part of plants is being used to produce second-generation biofuels, instead of being disposed. [98] But the use of second-generation biofuels increases the competition for lignocellulosic biomass, increasing the cost of these biofuels. [99] Third generation biofuels, produced from Algae, in theory shouldn't have as negative an impact on the environment than first or second generation biofuels, due to lower changes in land use and not requiring pesticide use for production. [100] When looking at the data however, it has been shown that the environmental cost to produce the infrastructure and energy required for third generation biofuel production, is higher than the benefits provided from the biofuels use. [101] The European Commission has officially approved a measure to phase out palm oil -based biofuels by 2030. [102] [103] Unsustainable palm oil agriculture has caused significant environmental and social problems, including deforestation and pollution. The production of biofuels can be very energy intensive, which if generated from non-renewable sources can heavily mitigate the benefits gained through biofuel use. A solution proposed to solve this issue is to supply biofuel production facilities with excess nuclear energy, which can supplement the energy provided by fossil fuels. [104] This can provide a carbon inexpensive solution, to help reduce the environmental impacts of biofuel production.",

This method greatly reduces smoke compared to traditional methods of burning crop waste. This method is known as the top-down burn or conservation burn. [24] [25] [26] Alternatively, more industrial methods can be used on small scales. While in a centralized system, unused biomass is brought to a central plant for processing into biochar, [27] it is also possible for each farmer or group of farmers can operate a kiln . [ citation needed ] In this scenario, a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass. Vehicle power comes from the syngas stream, while the biochar remains on the farm. The biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site. Factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts, the amount of material to be processed, and the ability to supply the power grid.

The atomic ratios of biochar, including H/C and O/C, correlate with the properties that are relevant to organic content, such as polarity and aromaticity . [38] A van-Krevelen diagram can show the evolution of biochar atomic ratios in the production process. [39] In the carbonization process, both the H / C and O /C atomic ratios decrease due to the release of functional groups that contain hydrogen and oxygen. [40] Production temperatures influence biochar properties in several ways. The molecular carbon structure of the solid biochar matrix is particularly affected. Initial pyrolysis at 450–550 °C leaves an amorphous carbon structure. Temperatures above this range will result in the progressive thermochemical conversion of amorphous carbon into turbostratic graphene sheets. Biochar conductivity also increases with production temperature. [41] [42] [43] Important to carbon capture, aromaticity and intrinsic recalcitrance increases with temperature. [44]",

        "text": "Biochar offers multiple soil health benefits in degraded tropical soils but is less beneficial in temperate regions. [68] [69] Its porous nature is effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients. Soil biologist Elaine Ingham highlighted its suitability as a habitat for beneficial soil micro organisms . [70] She pointed out that when pre-charged with these beneficial organisms, biochar promotes good soil and plant health. Biochar reduces leaching of E-coli through sandy soils depending on application rate, feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, soil moisture content, soil texture , and surface properties of the bacteria. [71] [72] [73] For plants that require high potash and elevated pH , [74] biochar can improve yield. [75] Biochar can improve water quality, reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases , reduce nutrient leaching , reduce soil acidity , [76] and reduce irrigation and fertilizer requirements. [77] Under certain circumstances biochar induces plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and improves plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens. [78] [79] [80] Biochar's impacts are dependent on its properties [81] as well as the amount applied, [80] although knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties is limited. [82] Biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type, soil condition (depleted or healthy), temperature, and humidity. [83] Modest additions of biochar reduce nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) [84] emissions by up to 80% and eliminate methane emissions , which are both more potent greenhouse gases than CO 2 . [85] Studies reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrient–poor soils. [86] The application of compost and biochar under FP7 project FERTIPLUS had positive effects on soil humidity, crop productivity and quality in multiple countries. [87] Biochar can be adapted with specific qualities to target distinct soil properties. [88] In Colombian savanna soil, biochar reduced leaching of critical nutrients, created a higher nutrient uptake, and provided greater nutrient availability. [89] At 10% levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to 80%, while reducing chlordane and DDX content in the plants by 68 and 79%, respectively. [90] However, because of its high adsorption capacity, biochar may reduce pesticide efficacy. [91] [92] High-surface-area biochars may be particularly problematic. [91] Biochar may be plowed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils. It has meant a remarkable improvement in tropical soils showing positive effects in increasing soil fertility and improving disease resistance in West European soils. [87] Gardeners taking individual action on climate change add biochar to soil, [93] increasing plant yield and thereby drawing down more carbon. [94] The use of biochar as a feed additive can be a way to apply biochar to pastures and to reduce methane emissions. [95] [96] Application rates of 2.5–20 tonnes per hectare (1.0–8.1 t/acre) appear required to improve plant yields significantly. Biochar costs in developed countries vary from $300–7000/tonne, which is generally impractical for the farmer/horticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops. In developing countries, constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time. A compromise is to use small amounts of biochar in lower-cost biochar-fertilizer complexes. [97]",

The nitrogen and carbon in the dung were both incorporated into the soil rather than staying on the soil surface, reducing the production of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide . The nitrogen and carbon added to soil fertility. On-farm evidence indicates that the fodder led to improvements of liveweight gain in Angus-cross cattle . [104] Doug Pow won the Australian Government Innovation in Agriculture Land Management Award at the 2019 Western Australian Landcare Awards for this innovation.

[115] Research is in progress by the University of Edinburgh , [116] the University of Georgia , [117] [118] the Volcani Center , [119] and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences . [120] Research is also ongoing on the application of biochar to coarse soils in semi-arid and degraded ecosystems. In Namibia biochar is under exploration as climate change adaptation effort, strengthening local communities' drought resilience and food security through the local production and application of biochar from abundant encroacher biomass . [121] In recent years, biochar has attracted interest as a wastewater filtration medium as well as for its adsorbing capacity for the wastewater pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products , [122] and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances . [123] [124] [125] In some areas, citizen interest and support for biochar motivates government research into the uses of biochar. [126] [127]",
