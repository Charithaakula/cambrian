        "text": "The two most important forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, are intermittent energy sources : they are not available constantly, resulting in lower capacity factors . In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

[52] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions , geographic location and time of day. [53] There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal , which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity. [12] PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022. [54] It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, [55] compared to 25 GW of solar thermal. [54] Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building. Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments. China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013. Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19 , growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines. Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.

[61] A household's solar panels can either be used for just that household or, if connected to an electrical grid, can be aggregated with millions of others.

        "text": "Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC. Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps. Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy. [82] There are many forms of water energy: Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar. [86] In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,360 GW. [68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol. Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 [98] and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention . Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

This is an 85% acceleration from the previous five years, and almost 30% higher than what the IEA forecast in its 2021 report, making its largest ever upward revision. Renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period. [68] To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, IEA believes that 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources. [17] In June 2022 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to \"ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.\" [185] China's five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal. [186] REPowerEU , the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas , is expected to call for much more green hydrogen . [187] After a transitional period, [188] renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world's energy production. In 2018, the risk management firm, DNV GL , forecasts that the world's primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and non-fossil sources by 2050. [189]",

Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy. [199] The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [205] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal . [206] For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\" [207]",

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

This means giving communities both a say and a stake.\" [264] In the 2000s and early 2010s, many renewable projects in Germany, Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities, particularly through cooperative structures.

As of 2019, 85% of the world's energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels. [13] Energy production and consumption are responsible for 76% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2018. [14] [15] The 2015 international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global warming to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) and preferably to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F); achieving this goal will require that emissions be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century. [16] The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major source of air pollution, [17] [18] which causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. [19] Fossil-fuel burning in power plants, vehicles, and factories is the main source of emissions that combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to cause acid rain . [20] Air pollution is the second-leading cause of death from non-infectious disease. [21] An estimated 99% of the world's population lives with levels of air pollution that exceed the World Health Organization recommended limits. [22] Cooking with polluting fuels such as wood, animal dung, coal, or kerosene is responsible for nearly all indoor air pollution, which causes an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million deaths annually, [23] [21] and also contributes significantly to outdoor air pollution. [24] Health effects are concentrated among women, who are likely to be responsible for cooking, and young children. [24] Environmental impacts extend beyond the by-products of combustion. Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions. [25] Around 10% of global water use goes to energy production, mainly for cooling in thermal energy plants. In dry regions, this contributes to water scarcity . Bioenergy production, coal mining and processing, and oil extraction also require large amounts of water. [26] Excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material for burning can cause serious local environmental damage, including desertification . [27]",

[36] [37] The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that increasing energy efficiency could achieve 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris Agreement's goals. [38] Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances, vehicles, industrial processes, and buildings. [39] Another approach is to use fewer materials whose production requires a lot of energy, for example through better building design and recycling. Behavioural changes such as using videoconferencing rather than business flights, or making urban trips by cycling, walking or public transport rather than by car, are another way to conserve energy. [40] Government policies to improve efficiency can include building codes , performance standards , carbon pricing , and the development of energy-efficient infrastructure to encourage changes in transport modes . [40] [41] The energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product (GDP)) is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production. [42] In 2010, global energy intensity was 5.6 megajoules (1.6 kWh ) per US dollar of GDP. [42] United Nations goals call for energy intensity to decrease by 2.6% each year between 2010 and 2030. [43] In recent years this target has not been met. For instance, between 2017 and 2018, energy intensity decreased by only 1.1%. [43] Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services. [44] For example, recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour , such as selecting larger vehicles and homes. [45]",

Solar PV is expected to be the electricity source with the largest installed capacity worldwide by 2027. [59] The panels are mounted on top of buildings or installed in utility-scale solar parks . Costs of solar photovoltaic cells have dropped rapidly, driving strong growth in worldwide capacity. [62] The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places, cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants. [63] Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix. [64] [65] Most components of solar panels can be easily recycled, but this is not always done in the absence of regulation. [66] Panels typically contain heavy metals , so they pose environmental risks if put in landfills . [67] It takes fewer than two years for a solar panel to produce as much energy as was used for its production. Less energy is needed if materials are recycled rather than mined. [68] In concentrated solar power , solar rays are concentrated by a field of mirrors, heating a fluid. Electricity is produced from the resulting steam with a heat engine . Concentrated solar power can support dispatchable power generation , as some of the heat is typically stored to enable electricity to be generated when needed. [69] [70] In addition to electricity production, solar energy is used more directly; solar thermal heating systems are used for hot water production, heating buildings, drying, and desalination.

In 2020, hydropower supplied 17% of the world's electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to-late 20th century. [80] [81] In conventional hydropower, a reservoir is created behind a dam. Conventional hydropower plants provide a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply. They can be combined with wind and solar power to meet peaks in demand and to compensate when wind and sun are less available. [82] Compared to reservoir-based facilities, run-of-the-river hydroelectricity generally has less environmental impact. However, its ability to generate power depends on river flow, which can vary with daily and seasonal weather. Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation. [83] Hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects. [84] The highest emissions tend to occur with large dams in tropical regions. [85] These emissions are produced when the biological matter that becomes submerged in the reservoir's flooding decomposes and releases carbon dioxide and methane. Deforestation and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams. [82] Depending on location, large dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage; potential dam failure could place the surrounding population at risk. [82]",

[92] It can either be burned to produce heat and electricity or be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, which can be used to power vehicles. [93] [94] The climate impact of bioenergy varies considerably depending on where biomass feedstocks come from and how they are grown. [95] For example, burning wood for energy releases carbon dioxide; those emissions can be significantly offset if the trees that were harvested are replaced by new trees in a well-managed forest, as the new trees will absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. [96] However, the establishment and cultivation of bioenergy crops can displace natural ecosystems , degrade soils , and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers. [97] [98] Approximately one-third of all wood used for traditional heating and cooking in tropical areas is harvested unsustainably. [99] Bioenergy feedstocks typically require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport; the energy usage for these processes may emit greenhouse gases. In some cases, the impacts of land-use change , cultivation, and processing can result in higher overall carbon emissions for bioenergy compared to using fossil fuels. [98] [100] Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food . In the United States, around 10% of motor gasoline has been replaced by corn-based ethanol , which requires a significant proportion of the harvest. [101] [102] In Malaysia and Indonesia, clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects , as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for diverse species. [103] [104] Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight, producing a given amount of bioenergy requires a large amount of land compared to other renewable energy sources. [105] Second-generation biofuels which are produced from non-food plants or waste reduce competition with food production, but may have other negative effects including trade-offs with conservation areas and local air pollution. [95] Relatively sustainable sources of biomass include algae , waste, and crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production. [95] Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants. This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would require converting large amounts of cropland. [106]",

[123] As of 2019, nuclear generated over a quarter of all low-carbon energy , making it the second largest source after hydropower. [89] Nuclear power's lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions—including the mining and processing of uranium —are similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources. [84] Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables.  Additionally, Nuclear power does not create local air pollution. [124] [125] Although the uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, enough exists to provide a supply for hundreds to thousands of years. [126] [127] However, uranium resources that can be accessed in an economically feasible manner, at the present state, are limited and uranium production could hardly keep up during the expansion phase. [128] Climate change mitigation pathways consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear. [129] There is controversy over whether nuclear power is sustainable, in part due to concerns around nuclear waste , nuclear weapon proliferation , and accidents . [130] Radioactive nuclear waste must be managed for thousands of years [130] and nuclear power plants create fissile material that can be used for weapons. [130] For each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy has caused far fewer accidental and pollution-related deaths than fossil fuels, and the historic fatality rate of nuclear is comparable to renewable sources. [115] Public opposition to nuclear energy often makes nuclear plants politically difficult to implement. [130] Reducing the time and the cost of building new nuclear plants have been goals for decades but costs remain high and timescales long. [131] Various new forms of nuclear energy are in development, hoping to address the drawbacks of conventional plants. Fast breeder reactors are capable of recycling nuclear waste and therefore can significantly reduce the amount of waste that requires geological disposal , but have not yet been deployed on a large-scale commercial basis. [132] Nuclear power based on thorium (rather than uranium) may be able to provide higher energy security for countries that do not have a large supply of uranium. [133] Small modular reactors may have several advantages over current large reactors: It should be possible to build them faster and their modularization would allow for cost reductions via learning-by-doing . [134] Several countries are attempting to develop nuclear fusion reactors, which would generate small amounts of waste and no risk of explosions. [135] Although fusion power has taken steps forward in the lab, the multi-decade timescale needed to bring it to commercialization and then scale means it will not contribute to a 2050 net zero goal for climate change mitigation.

        "text": "The emissions reductions necessary to keep global warming below 2 °C will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed. [13] For a society to replace one form of energy with another, multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change. For example, transitioning from oil to solar power as the energy source for cars requires the generation of solar electricity, modifications to the electrical grid to accommodate fluctuations in solar panel output or the introduction of variable battery chargers and higher overall demand, adoption of electric cars , and networks of electric vehicle charging facilities and repair shops. [138] Many climate change mitigation pathways envision three main aspects of a low-carbon energy system: Some energy-intensive technologies and processes are difficult to electrify, including aviation, shipping, and steelmaking. There are several options for reducing the emissions from these sectors: biofuels and synthetic carbon-neutral fuels can power many vehicles that are designed to burn fossil fuels, however biofuels cannot be sustainably produced in the quantities needed and synthetic fuels are currently very expensive. [140] For some applications, the most prominent alternative to electrification is to develop a system based on sustainably-produced hydrogen fuel . [141] Full decarbonisation of the global energy system is expected to take several decades and can mostly be achieved with existing technologies. [142] In the IEA's proposal for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, about 35% of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of 2023. [143] Technologies that are relatively immature include batteries  and processes to create carbon-neutral fuels. [144] [145] Developing new technologies requires research and development, demonstration , and cost reductions via deployment . [144] The transition to a zero-carbon energy system will bring strong co-benefits for human health: The World Health Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions of lives each year from reductions to air pollution alone. [146] [147] With good planning and management, pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030 in ways that are consistent with climate goals. [148] [149] Historically, several countries have made rapid economic gains through coal usage. [148] However, there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to \" leapfrog \" fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables, given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer.

[151] Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. [152] As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. [153] In 2019, these sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity, a share that has grown rapidly. [61] There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale: there is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low. [153] Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability. [154] Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids , matching the times when variable energy production is highest. With grid energy storage , energy produced in excess can be released when needed. [153] Further flexibility could be provided from sector coupling , that is coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat -systems and electric vehicles. [155] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather. In optimal weather, energy generation may have to be curtailed if excess electricity cannot be used or stored. The final demand-supply mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower, bioenergy, or natural gas. [156]",

[164] One of the easiest and fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to phase out coal-fired power plants and increase renewable electricity generation. [139] Climate change mitigation pathways envision extensive electrification—the use of electricity as a substitute for the direct burning of fossil fuels for heating buildings and for transport. [139] Ambitious climate policy would see a doubling of energy share consumed as electricity by 2050, from 20% in 2020. [165] One of the challenges in providing universal access to electricity is distributing power to rural areas. Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy, such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village, are important solutions. [166] Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world. [167] Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals, such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels. [168] Recycling can meet some of this demand if product lifecycles are well-designed, however achieving net zero emissions would still require major increases in mining for 17 types of metals and minerals.

Public transport typically emits fewer greenhouse gases per passenger than personal vehicles, since trains and buses can carry many more passengers at once. [186] [187] Short-distance flights can be replaced by high-speed rail , which is more efficient, especially when electrified. [188] [189] Promoting non-motorised transport such as walking and cycling, particularly in cities, can make transport cleaner and healthier. [190] [191] The energy efficiency of cars has increased over time, [192] but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution. [193] A large proportion of traffic-related air pollution consists of particulate matter from road dust and the wearing-down of tyres and brake pads. [194] Substantially reducing pollution from these non-tailpipe sources cannot be achieved by electrification; it requires measures such as making vehicles lighter and driving them less. [195] Light-duty cars in particular are a prime candidate for decarbonization using battery technology . 25% of the world's CO 2 emissions still originate from the transportation sector. [196] Long-distance freight transport and aviation are difficult sectors to electrify with current technologies, mostly because of the weight of batteries needed for long-distance travel, battery recharging times, and limited battery lifespans. [197] [160] Where available, freight transport by ship and rail is generally more sustainable than by air and by road. [198] Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles such as lorries.

[205] To heat buildings, alternatives to burning fossil fuels and biomass include electrification through heat pumps or electric heaters , geothermal energy , central solar heating , reuse of waste heat , and seasonal thermal energy storage . [206] [207] [208] Heat pumps provide both heat and air conditioning through a single appliance. [209] The IEA estimates heat pumps could provide over 90% of space and water heating requirements globally. [210] A highly efficient way to heat buildings is through district heating , in which heat is generated in a centralised location and then distributed to multiple buildings through insulated pipes . Traditionally, most district heating systems have used fossil fuels, but modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use high shares of renewable energy. [211] [212] Cooling of buildings can be made more efficient through passive building design , planning that minimises the urban heat island effect, and district cooling systems that cool multiple buildings with piped cold water. [213] [214] Air conditioning requires large amounts of electricity and is not always affordable for poorer households. [214] Some air conditioning units still use refrigerants that are greenhouse gases, as some countries have not ratified the Kigali Amendment to only use climate-friendly refrigerants. [215] In developing countries where populations suffer from energy poverty , polluting fuels such as wood or animal dung are often used for cooking. Cooking with these fuels is generally unsustainable, because they release harmful smoke and because harvesting wood can lead to forest degradation. [216] The universal adoption of clean cooking facilities, which are already ubiquitous in rich countries, [203] would dramatically improve health and have minimal negative effects on climate. [217] [218] Clean cooking facilities, e.g. cooking facilities that produce less indoor soot, typically use natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (both of which consume oxygen and produce carbon-dioxide) or electricity as the energy source; biogas systems are a promising alternative in some contexts. [203] Improved cookstoves that burn biomass more efficiently than traditional stoves are an interim solution where transitioning to clean cooking systems is difficult. [219]",

        "text": "Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security and lessen the financial burden of using energy. [226] Environmental regulations have been used since the 1970s to promote more sustainable use of energy. [227] Some governments have committed to dates for phasing out coal-fired power plants and ending new fossil fuel exploration . Governments can require that new cars produce zero emissions, or new buildings are heated by electricity instead of gas. [228] Renewable portfolio standards in several countries require utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources. [229] [230] Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as long-distance electrical transmission lines, smart grids, and hydrogen pipelines. [231] In transport, appropriate infrastructure and incentives can make travel more efficient and less car-dependent. [226] Urban planning that discourages sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality of life. [226] Government-funded research, procurement, and incentive policies have historically been critical to the development and maturation of clean energy technologies, such as solar and lithium batteries. [232] In the IEA's scenario for a net zero-emission energy system by 2050, public funding is rapidly mobilised to bring a range of newer technologies to the demonstration phase and to encourage deployment. [233] Carbon pricing (such as a tax on CO 2 emissions) gives industries and consumers an incentive to reduce emissions while letting them choose how to do so. For example, they can shift to low-emission energy sources, improve energy efficiency, or reduce their use of energy-intensive products and services. [234] Carbon pricing has encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer. [235] [236] Most studies indicate that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, carbon pricing would need to be complemented by stringent energy-specific policies. [237] As of 2019, the price of carbon in most regions is too low to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. [238] Carbon taxes provide a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes [239] or help lower-income households afford higher energy costs. [240] Some governments, such as the EU and the UK, are exploring the use of carbon border adjustments . [241] These place tariffs on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies, to ensure that industries subject to internal carbon prices remain competitive. [242] [243] The scale and pace of policy reforms that have been initiated as of 2020 are far less than needed to fulfil the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. [244] [245] In addition to domestic policies, greater international cooperation is required to accelerate innovation and to assist poorer countries in establishing a sustainable path to full energy access. [246] Countries may support renewables to create jobs. [247] The International Labour Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 2 °C would result in net job creation in most sectors of the economy. [248] It predicts that 24 million new jobs would be created by 2030 in areas such as renewable electricity generation, improving energy-efficiency in buildings, and the transition to electric vehicles. Six million jobs would be lost, in sectors such as mining and fossil fuels. [248] Governments can make the transition to sustainable energy more politically and socially feasible by ensuring a just transition for workers and regions that depend on the fossil fuel industry, to ensure they have alternative economic opportunities.

[250] The IPCC estimates that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, US$2.4 trillion would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035. Most studies project that these costs, equivalent to 2.5% of world GDP, would be small compared to the economic and health benefits. [251] Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be six times more by 2050 compared to 2015. [252] Underfunding is particularly acute in the least developed countries, which are not attractive to the private sector. [253] The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimates that climate financing totalled $681 billion in 2016. [254] Most of this is private-sector investment in renewable energy deployment, public-sector investment in sustainable transport, and private-sector investment in energy efficiency. [255] The Paris Agreement includes a pledge of an extra $100 billion per year from developed countries to poor countries, to do climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, this goal has not been met and measurement of progress has been hampered by unclear accounting rules. [256] [257] If energy-intensive businesses like chemicals, fertilizers, ceramics, steel, and non-ferrous metals invest significantly in R&D, its usage in industry might amount to between 5% and 20% of all energy used. [258] [259] Fossil fuel funding and subsidies are a significant barrier to the energy transition. [260] [250] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies were $319 billion in 2017. This rises to $5.2 trillion when indirect costs are priced in, like the effects of air pollution. [261] Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths. [262] Funding for clean energy has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic , and pandemic-related economic stimulus packages offer possibilities for a green recovery . [263] [264]",

The most important by-products are wood residues, agricultural residues and municipal/industrial waste: Wood residues are by-products from forestry operations or from the wood processing industry. Had the residues not been collected and used for bioenergy, they would have decayed (and therefore produced emissions) [g] on the forest floor or in landfills, or been burnt (and produced emissions) at the side of the road in forests or outside wood processing facilities. [24] The by-products from forestry operations are called logging residues or forest residues, and consist of tree tops, branches, stumps, damaged or dying or dead trees, irregular or bent stem sections, thinnings (small trees that are cleared away in order to help the bigger trees grow large), and trees removed to reduce wildfire risk. [h] The extraction level of logging residues differ from region to region, [i] [j] but there is an increasing interest in using this feedstock, [k] since the sustainable potential is large (15 EJ annually). [l] 68% of the total forest biomass in the EU consists of wood stems, and 32% consists of stumps, branches and tops. [25] The by-products from the wood processing industry are called wood processing residues and consist of cut offs, shavings, sawdust, bark, and black liquor. [26] Wood processing residues have a total energy content of 5.5 EJ annually. [27] Wood pellets are mainly made from wood processing residues, [m] and have a total energy content of 0.7 EJ. [n] Wood chips are made from a combination of feedstocks, [28] and have a total energy content of 0.8 EJ. [o] The energy content in agricultural residues used for energy is approximately 2 EJ. [p] However, agricultural residues has a large untapped potential. The energy content in the global production of agricultural residues has been estimated to 78 EJ annually, with the largest share from straw (51 EJ). [q] Others have estimated between 18 and 82 EJ. [r] The use of agricultural residues and waste that is both sustainable and economically feasible [12] : 9 is expected to increase to between 37 and 66 EJ in 2030.

[aq] Short carbon payback/parity times are produced when the most realistic no-bioenergy scenario is a traditional forestry scenario where \"good\" wood stems are harvested for lumber production, and residues are burned or left behind in the forest or in landfills. The collection of such residues provides material which \"[...] would have released its carbon (via decay or burning) back to the atmosphere anyway (over time spans defined by the biome's decay rate) [...].\" [63] In other words, payback and parity times depend on the decay speed. The decay speed depends on a.) location (because decay speed is \"[...] roughly proportional to temperature and rainfall [...]\" [64] ), and b.) the thickness of the residues. [ar] Residues decay faster in warm and wet areas, and thin residues decay faster than thick residues. Thin residues in warm and wet temperate forests therefore have the fastest decay, while thick residues in cold and dry boreal forests have the slowest decay. If the residues instead are burned in the no-bioenergy scenario, e.g. outside the factories or at roadside in the forests, emissions are instant. In this case, parity times approach zero. [as] Like other scientists, the JRC staff note the high variability in carbon accounting results, and attribute this to different methodologies. [at] In the studies examined, the JRC found carbon parity times of 0 to 400 years for stemwood harvested exclusively for bioenergy, depending on different characteristics and assumptions for both the forest/bioenergy system and the alternative fossil system, with the emission intensity of the displaced fossil fuels seen as the most important factor, followed by conversion efficiency and biomass growth rate/rotation time. Other factors relevant for the carbon parity time are the initial carbon stock and the existing harvest level; both higher initial carbon stock and higher harvest level means longer parity times. [65] Liquid biofuels have high parity times because about half of the energy content of the biomass is lost in the processing. [au]",

        "text": "EU's Joint Research Centre has examined a number of bioenergy emission estimates found in literature, and calculated greenhouse gas savings percentages for bioenergy pathways in heat production, transportation fuel production and electricity production, based on those studies. The calculations are based on the attributional LCA accounting principle. It includes all supply chain emissions, from raw material extraction, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to end-of-life treatment and final disposal. It also includes emissions related to the production of the fossil fuels used in the supply chain. It excludes emission/absorption effects that takes place outside its system boundaries, for instance market related, biogeophysical (e.g. albedo), and time-dependent effects. The authors conclude that \"[m]ost bio-based commodities release less GHG than fossil products along their supply chain; but the magnitude of GHG emissions vary greatly with logistics, type of feedstocks, land and ecosystem management, resource efficiency, and technology.\" [67] Because of the varied climate mitigation potential for different biofuel pathways, governments and organizations set up different certification schemes to ensure that biomass use is sustainable, for instance the RED (Renewable Energy Directive) in the EU and the ISO standard 13065 by the International Organization for Standardization. [68] In the US, the RFS (Renewables Fuel Standard) limit the use of traditional biofuels and defines the minimum life-cycle GHG emissions that are acceptable. Biofuels are considered traditional if they achieve up to 20% GHG emission reduction compared to the petrochemical equivalent, advanced if they save at least 50%, and cellulosic if the save more than 60%. [av] The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) states that the typical greenhouse gas emissions savings when replacing fossil fuels with wood pellets from forest residues for heat production varies between 69% and 77%, depending on transport distance: When the distance is between 0 and 2500 km, emission savings is 77%. Emission savings drop to 75% when the distance is between 2500 and 10 000 km, and to 69% when the distance is above 10 000 km. When stemwood is used, emission savings varies between 70% and 77%, depending on transport distance. When wood industry residues are used, savings varies between 79% and 87%. [aw] Since the long payback and parity times calculated for some forestry projects is seen as a non-issue for energy crops (except in the cases mentioned above), researchers instead calculate static climate mitigation potentials for these crops, using LCA-based carbon accounting methods. A particular energy crop-based bioenergy project is considered carbon positive, carbon neutral or carbon negative based on the total amount of CO 2 equivalent emissions and absorptions accumulated throughout its entire lifetime: If emissions during agriculture, processing, transport and combustion are higher than what is absorbed (and stored) by the plants, both above and below ground, during the project's lifetime, the project is carbon positive. Likewise, if total absorption is higher than total emissions, the project is carbon negative. In other words, carbon negativity is possible when net carbon accumulation more than compensates for net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO 2 . [ax] [62] : 393 There is now (2018) consensus in the scientific community that \"[...] the GHG [greenhouse gas] balance of perennial bioenergy crop cultivation will often be favourable [...]\", also when considering the implicit direct and indirect land use changes.

[60] : 3 There is also a loss of soil carbon due to the harvest operations. [60] : 3 Old trees absorb more CO 2 than young trees, because of the larger leaf area in full grown trees. [73] However, the old forest (as a whole) will eventually stop absorbing CO 2 because CO 2 emissions from dead trees cancel out the remaining living trees' CO 2 absorption. [ay] The old forest (or forest stands) are also vulnerable for natural disturbances that produces CO 2 . The IPCC found that \"[...] landscapes with older forests have accumulated more carbon but their sink strength is diminishing, while landscapes with younger forests contain less carbon but they are removing CO 2 from the atmosphere at a much higher rate [...].\" [62] : 386 The IPCC states that the net climate effect from conversion of unmanaged to managed forest can be positive or negative, depending on circumstances. The carbon stock is reduced , but since managed forests grow faster than unmanaged forests, more carbon is absorbed . Positive climate effects are produced if the harvested biomass is used efficiently. [62] : 351 There is a tradeoff between the benefits of having a maximized forest carbon stock, not absorbing any more carbon, and the benefits of having a portion of that carbon stock \"unlocked\", and instead working as a renewable fossil fuel replacement tool, for instance in sectors which are difficult or expensive to decarbonize. [31] [az] The \"competition\" between locked-away and unlocked forest carbon might be won by the unlocked carbon: \"In the long term, using sustainably produced forest biomass as a substitute for carbon-intensive products and fossil fuels provides greater permanent reductions in atmospheric CO 2 than preservation does.\" [74] : 39 IEA Bioenergy writes: \"forests managed for producing sawn timber, bioenergy and other wood products can make a greater contribution to climate change mitigation than forests managed for conservation alone.\" Three reasons are given: [75] Data from FAO show that most wood pellets are produced in regions dominated by sustainably managed forests, such as Europe and North America. Europe (including Russia) produced 54% of the world's wood pellets in 2019, and the forest carbon stock in this area increased from 158.7 to 172.4 Gt between 1990 and 2020. In the EU, above-ground forest biomass increases with 1.3% per year on average, however the increase is slowing down because the forests are maturing. [76] United Kingdom Emissions Trading System allows operators of CO2 generating installations to apply zero emissions factor for the fraction used for non-energy purposes, while energy purposes (electricity generation, heating) require additional sustainability certification on the biomass used.

        "text": "Since the passage of the Directive on Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources in 1997, Germany and the other states of the European Union were working towards a target of 12% renewable electricity by 2010. Germany passed this target early in 2007, when the renewable energy share in electricity consumption in Germany reached 14%. [14] In September 2010, the German government announced ambitious energy targets: [15] : 5 After the 2013 elections, the new CDU/CSU and SPD coalition government continued the energy transition , with only minor modifications of its targets in the coalition agreement. [16] These targets include, for renewable energy: The German Government reported, in 2011, renewable energy (mainly wind turbines and biomass plants) generated more than 123 TWh of electricity, providing nearly 20% of the 603 TWh of electricity supplied. [18] By 2012, all renewable energy accounted for 21.9% of electricity, with wind turbines and photovoltaic providing 11.9% of the total. [19] As of 2017, renewable sources account for 38% of the net electricity production. Compared to the same period of 2016, energy production from renewable energy sources increased from 182 TWh to 210 TWh. It marks the first year where solar and wind are the biggest source of energy. Power production from nuclear power plants decreased by 10%, due to maintenance. Use of hard coal decreased by 16%, while production from lignite stayed on a similar level and increased for gas by 2.6 TWh. [20] : 4–6 The renewable installations have come under criticism as well. A balance made in 2017 has shown that whilst emissions in 2016 were 28 percent lower than 1990, the country was likely to fall short of its 2020 target of a 40 percent reduction on 1990 emission levels. The 40 percent reduction target of 2020 will not be met unless \"spectacular\" additional efforts are made. [21] [22] One significant reason why Germany may miss its 2020 target is because the country's electricity exports have been growing strongly in recent years to surpass France as Europe's largest electricity exporter. A recent study calculates that Germany exports the equivalent of the annual output from 7GW of lignite generation – producing 59 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions in the process, a figure which accounts for around half of the shortfall in CO 2 emissions it needs to meet its 2020 targets. [23] Replacing the baseload power from fossil fuels has proven more challenging after nuclear power plants have been shut down although the proportion of electricity generated by coal for domestic use has been falling year on year. In July 2019, figures published by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) report that renewable energy is for the first time providing more electricity than coal and nuclear power combined in Germany. Solar, wind, biomass and hydroelectric power generates nearly half of the country's output. [24] [25] Times with negative prices increased as solar and wind power increased. Solar and wind power has low marginal cost , and other production sources with higher fuel costs become less competitive when demand and prices are low. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany , solar power in Germany occasionally produced 32 gigawatt (GW). Solar, together with wind and other renewables, accounted for 78% of German power at one point. [26]",

        "section": "Biodiesel",
        "text": "Biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ( FAMEs ). [27] Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, soy , rapeseed , jatropha , mahua , mustard , flax , sunflower , palm oil , hemp , field pennycress , Pongamia pinnata and algae . Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as \"neat\" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100. [28] As of 2020 [update] , researchers at Australia's CSIRO have been studying safflower oil as an engine lubricant , and researchers at Montana State University 's Advanced Fuels Center in the US have been studying the oil's performance in a large diesel engine , with results described as a \"breakthrough\". [29] Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine and modified equipment when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. [30] Electronically controlled ' common rail ' and ' Unit Injector ' type systems from the late 1990s onwards can only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are designed to run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the fuel rail design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, engine filters may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO x -emissions [31] Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable , and has a high flash point of about 300 °F (148 °C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125 °F (52 °C). [32] In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. [33] [34] In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. [35] Avril Group produces under the brand Diester , a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union . [36] It is the leading European producer of biodiesel. [35]",

[21] Oils and fats reacted with 10 pounds of a short-chain alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst (usually sodium hydroxide [NaOH] can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute.

Hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions.

[52] They also enhance engine performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions . By greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions, they contribute to improved air quality. [53] [54] In transportation fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), methyl tert -butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert -butyl ether (ETBE), tert -amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tert -amyl ethyl ether (TAEE). [55] The European Fuel Oxygenates Association identifies MTBE and ETBE as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. [56] Although Europeans still use bioether additives, the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 lifted a requirement for reformulated gasoline to include an oxygenate, leading to less MTBE being added to fuel. [57] Although bioethers are likely to replace ethers produced from petroleum in the UK, it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density. [58]",

        "section": "Environmental impacts",
        "text": "Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined. [6] In general, biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon they emit has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in biofuel production. [5] They can have greenhouse gas emissions ranging from as low as -127.1 gCO2eq per MJ when carbon capture is incorporated into their production to those exceeding 95 gCO2eq per MJ when land-use change is significant. [40] [41] Several factors are responsible for the variation in emission numbers of biofuel such as feedstock and its origin, fuel production technique, system boundary definitions, and energy sources. [41] However, many government policies such as those by European Union and the UK require that biofuels have at least 65% greenhouse gas emissions savings (or 70% if it is renewable fuels of non-biological origins) relative to fossil fuels. [93] [94] Life-cycle assessments of first generation biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks. [6] [7] If no land-use change is involved, first-generation biofuels can—on average—have lower emissions than fossil fuels. [6] However, biofuel production can compete with foodcrop production. Up to 40% of corn produced in the United States is used to make ethanol [95] and worldwide 10% of all grain is turned into biofuel. [96] A 50% reduction in grain used for biofuels in the US and Europe would replace all of Ukraine 's grain exports. [97] Several studies have shown that reductions in emissions from biofuels are achieved at the expense of other impacts, such as acidification , eutrophication , water footprint and biodiversity loss . [6] The use of second generation biofuels is thought to increase environmental sustainability, since the non-food part of plants is being used to produce second-generation biofuels, instead of being disposed. [98] But the use of second-generation biofuels increases the competition for lignocellulosic biomass, increasing the cost of these biofuels. [99] Third generation biofuels, produced from Algae, in theory shouldn't have as negative an impact on the environment than first or second generation biofuels, due to lower changes in land use and not requiring pesticide use for production. [100] When looking at the data however, it has been shown that the environmental cost to produce the infrastructure and energy required for third generation biofuel production, is higher than the benefits provided from the biofuels use. [101] The European Commission has officially approved a measure to phase out palm oil -based biofuels by 2030. [102] [103] Unsustainable palm oil agriculture has caused significant environmental and social problems, including deforestation and pollution. The production of biofuels can be very energy intensive, which if generated from non-renewable sources can heavily mitigate the benefits gained through biofuel use. A solution proposed to solve this issue is to supply biofuel production facilities with excess nuclear energy, which can supplement the energy provided by fossil fuels. [104] This can provide a carbon inexpensive solution, to help reduce the environmental impacts of biofuel production.",

It is unclear how much molecular hydrogen is available in natural reservoirs, but at least one company [14] specializes in drilling wells to extract hydrogen. Most hydrogen in the lithosphere is bonded to oxygen in water. Manufacturing elemental hydrogen requires the consumption of a hydrogen carrier such as a fossil fuel or water. The former carrier consumes the fossil resource and in the steam methane reforming (SMR) process produces greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However, in the newer methane pyrolysis process no greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is produced. These processes typically require no further energy input beyond the fossil fuel. Decomposing water, the latter carrier, requires electrical or heat input, generated from some primary energy source (fossil fuel, nuclear power or a renewable energy ). Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power , referred to as green hydrogen . [15] When derived from natural gas by zero greenhouse emission methane pyrolysis, it is referred to as turquoise hydrogen.

        "text": "Hydrogen is industrially produced from steam reforming (SMR), which uses natural gas. [29] The energy content of the produced hydrogen is around 74% of the energy content of the original fuel, [30] as some energy is lost as excess heat during production. In general, steam reforming emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and is known as gray hydrogen. If the carbon dioxide is  captured and stored, the hydrogen produced is known as blue hydrogen. Steam methane reforming (SMR) produces hydrogen from natural gas, mostly methane (CH 4 ), and water. It is the cheapest source of industrial hydrogen, being the source of nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen. [31] The process consists of heating the gas to 700–1,100 °C (1,300–2,000 °F) in the presence of steam over a nickel catalyst . The resulting endothermic reaction forms carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ). [32] In the water-gas shift reaction , the carbon monoxide reacts with steam  to obtain further quantities of H 2 .  The WGSR also requires a catalyst, typically over iron oxide or other oxides . The byproduct is CO 2 . [32] Depending on the quality of the feedstock (natural gas, naphtha , etc.), one ton of hydrogen produced will also produce 9 to 12 tons of CO 2 , a greenhouse gas that may be captured . [33] For this process, high temperature steam (H 2 O) reacts with methane (CH 4 ) in an endothermic reaction to yield syngas . [34] In a second stage, additional hydrogen is generated through the lower-temperature, exothermic , water-gas shift reaction, performed at about 360 °C (680 °F): Essentially, the oxygen (O) atom is stripped from the additional water (steam) to oxidize CO to CO 2 . This oxidation also provides energy to maintain the reaction.  Additional heat required to drive the process is generally supplied by burning some portion of the methane.",

        "text": "Hydrogen can be made via high pressure electrolysis , low pressure electrolysis of water, or a range of other emerging electrochemical processes such as high temperature electrolysis or carbon assisted electrolysis. [35] However, current best processes for water electrolysis have an effective electrical efficiency of 70-80%, [36] [37] [38] so that producing 1 kg of hydrogen (which has a specific energy of 143 MJ/kg or about 40 kWh/kg) requires 50–55 kWh of electricity. In parts of the world, steam methane reforming is between $1–3/kg on average excluding hydrogen gas pressurization cost. This makes production of hydrogen via electrolysis cost competitive in many regions already, as outlined by Nel Hydrogen [39] and others, including an article by the IEA [40] examining the conditions which could lead to a competitive advantage for electrolysis. A small part (2% in 2019 [41] ) is produced by electrolysis using electricity and water, consuming approximately 50 to 55 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilogram of hydrogen produced. [42] Water electrolysis is using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. \nAs of 2020, less than 0.1% of hydrogen production comes from water electrolysis. [43] Electrolysis of water is 70–80% efficient (a 20–30% conversion loss) [44] [45] while steam reforming of natural gas has a thermal efficiency between 70 and 85%. [46] The electrical efficiency of electrolysis is expected to reach 82–86% [47] before 2030, while also maintaining durability as progress in this area continues apace. [48] Water electrolysis can operate at 50–80 °C (120–180 °F), while steam methane reforming requires temperatures at 700–1,100 °C (1,300–2,000 °F). [49] The difference between the two methods is the primary energy used; either electricity (for electrolysis) or natural gas (for steam methane reforming).  Due to their use of water, a readily available resource, electrolysis and similar water-splitting methods have attracted the interest of the scientific community. With the objective of reducing the cost of hydrogen production, renewable sources of energy have been targeted to allow electrolysis. [50] There are three main types of electrolytic cells , solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOECs), polymer electrolyte membrane cells (PEM) and alkaline electrolysis cells (AECs). [51] Traditionally, alkaline electrolysers are cheaper in terms of investment (they generally use nickel catalysts), but less-efficient; PEM electrolysers, conversely, are more expensive (they generally use expensive platinum group metal catalysts) but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities , and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough. [52] SOECs operate at high temperatures, typically around 800 °C (1,500 °F). At these high temperatures, a significant amount of the energy required can be provided as thermal energy (heat), and as such is termed high-temperature electrolysis . The heat energy can be provided from a number of different sources, including waste industrial heat, nuclear power stations or concentrated solar thermal plants . This has the potential to reduce the overall cost of the hydrogen produced by reducing the amount of electrical energy required for electrolysis. [53] [54] [55] [56] PEM electrolysis cells typically operate below 100 °C (212 °F). [53] These cells have the advantage of being comparatively simple and can be designed to accept widely varying voltage inputs, which makes them ideal for use with renewable sources of energy such as photovoltaic solar panels . [57] AECs optimally operate at high concentrations of electrolyte (KOH or potassium carbonate ) and at high temperatures, often near 200 °C (392 °F).",

        "text": "Efficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen (MJ/m 3 ), assuming standard temperature and pressure of the H 2 . The lower the energy used by a generator, the higher would be its efficiency; a 100%-efficient electrolyser would consume 39.4 kilowatt-hours per kilogram (142 MJ/kg) of hydrogen, [58] 12,749 joules per litre (12.75 MJ/m 3 ).  Practical electrolysis typically uses a rotating electrolyser, where centrifugal force helps separate gas bubbles from water. [59] Such an electrolyser at 15 bar pressure may consume 50 kilowatt-hours per kilogram (180 MJ/kg), and a further 15 kilowatt-hours (54 MJ) if the hydrogen is compressed for use in hydrogen cars. [60] Conventional alkaline electrolysis has an efficiency of about 70%, [61] however advanced alkaline water electrolysers with efficiency of up to 82% are available. [62] Accounting for the use of the higher heat value (because inefficiency via heat can be redirected back into the system to create the steam required by the catalyst), average working efficiencies for PEM electrolysis are around 80%, or 82% using the most modern alkaline electrolysers. [63] PEM efficiency is expected to increase to approximately 86% [64] before 2030. Theoretical efficiency for PEM electrolysers is predicted up to 94%. [65] As of 2020, the cost of hydrogen by electrolysis is around $3–8/kg. [66] Considering the industrial production of hydrogen, and using current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline electrolysis) which have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–82%, [67] [68] [69] producing 1 kg of hydrogen (which has a specific energy of 143 MJ/kg or about 40 kWh/kg) requires 50–55 kWh of electricity. At an electricity cost of $0.06/kWh, as set out in the Department of Energy hydrogen production targets for 2015, [70] the hydrogen cost is $3/kg. The US DOE target price for hydrogen in 2020 is $2.30/kg, requiring an electricity cost of $0.037/kWh, which is achievable given recent PPA tenders for wind and solar in many regions. [71] The report by IRENA.ORG is an extensive factual report of present-day industrial hydrogen production consuming about 53 to 70  kWh per kg could go down to about 45 kWh/kg H 2 . [72] The thermodynamic energy required for hydrogen by electrolysis  translates to 33 kWh/kg, which is higher than steam reforming with carbon capture and higher than methane pyrolysis.\nOne of the advantages of electrolysis over hydrogen from steam methane reforming (SMR) is that the hydrogen can be produced on-site, meaning that the costly process of delivery via truck or pipeline is avoided.",

An algal turf scrubber (ATS) mimics the algal turfs of a natural coral reef by taking in nutrient rich water from waste streams or natural water sources, and pulsing it over a sloped surface. [90] This surface is coated with a rough plastic membrane or a screen, which allows naturally occurring algal spores to settle and colonize the surface.  Once the algae has been established, it can be harvested every 5–15 days, [91] and can produce 18 metric tons of algal biomass per hectare per year. [92] In contrast to other methods, which focus primarily on a single high yielding species of algae, this method focuses on naturally occurring polycultures of algae.  As such, the lipid content of the algae in an ATS system is usually lower, which makes it more suitable for a fermented fuel product, such as ethanol, methane, or butanol. [92] Conversely, the harvested algae could be treated with a hydrothermal liquefaction process, which would make possible biodiesel, gasoline, and jet fuel production. [93] There are three major advantages of ATS over other systems. The first advantage is documented higher productivity over open pond systems. [94] The second is lower operating and fuel production costs.  The third is the elimination of contamination issues due to the reliance on naturally occurring algae species.  The projected costs for energy production in an ATS system are $0.75/kg, compared to a photobioreactor which would cost $3.50/kg. [92] Furthermore, due to the fact that the primary purpose of ATS is removing nutrients and pollutants out of water, and these costs have been shown to be lower than other methods of nutrient removal, this may incentivize the use of this technology for nutrient removal as the primary function, with biofuel production as an added benefit.

Most of the growth since 2001 can be seen in the expansion of wind generated power, and more recently, in the growth in solar generated power. Renewable energy in California is prominent, with around 29% of electricity coming from RPS -eligible renewable sources (including hydropower). [27] The United States has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, with the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation's energy demand. \nA quarter of the country's land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal. [28] Many of the new technologies that harness renewables—including wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels—are, or soon will be, economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85% of United States energy needs. Dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies. [28] Wind power and solar power are becoming increasingly important relative to the older and more established hydroelectric power source. By 2016 wind power covered 37.23% of total renewable electricity production against 43.62% for hydroelectric power. The remaining share of power was generated by biomass at 10.27%, solar power at 6.03% and geothermal with 2.86% of total renewable generation.

Wind power overtook hydroelectric as the largest source of renewable electricity generation in 2019, and accounted for 10.25% of the country's total electricity generation by in 2022. [34] Wind and solar accounted for two-thirds of new energy installations in the United States in 2015. [35] United States wind power installed capacity exceeds 141 GW as of 2023. [2] This capacity is exceeded only by China . The 1550MW Alta Wind Energy Center is the largest wind farm in the United States and the second largest in the world behind the Gansu Wind Farm . [36] There were 90,000 wind operations jobs in the United States in 2015. \nThe wind industry in the United States generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity. [37] Wind projects boost local tax bases, and revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land. [33] GE Energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer. [33] In 2013, wind power received $5.936 billion in federal funding, which is 37% of all federal funding for electricity generation. [38] The United States has the potential of installing 10 terawatt (TW) of onshore wind power and 4 TW of offshore wind. [39] The U.S. Department of Energy's report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20% of all the country's electricity, which included a contribution of 4% from offshore wind power . [37] Additional transmission lines will need to be added, to bring power from windy states to the rest of the country. [40] In August 2011, a coalition of 24 governors asked the Obama administration to provide a more favorable business climate for the development of wind power. [41] Wind power has particularly surged, with Colorado producing 16,000 GWh in 2023, a testament to the state's investment in this clean energy source. [42]",

[53] The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 485 MW photovoltaic station planned for Riverside County, California . Many schools and businesses have building-integrated photovoltaic solar panels on their roof. Most of these are grid connected and use net metering laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime. New Jersey leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. [54] California decided that it is not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff . Washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. [55] By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage. Tesla and a handful of other companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale grid energy storage including very large batteries. Beginning with the 2014 data year,  Energy Information Administration has estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation and distributed solar photovoltaic capacity.

        "text": "At the end of 2016 there were 1.76 GW total installed capacity of solar thermal power across the United States. [2] Solar thermal power is generally utility-scale.\nPrior to 2012, in six southwestern states, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah, the US Bureau of Land Management owned nearly 98 million acres (400,000 km 2 ), an area larger than the state of Montana, that was open to proposals for solar power installations. \nTo streamline consideration of applications, the BLM produced a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). In October 2012, the BLM withdrew 78% of its land from possible solar development, leaving 19 million acres (77,000 km 2 ) still open to applications for solar installations, an area nearly as large as South Carolina. Of the area left open to solar proposals, the BLM has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls Solar Energy Zones. [56] [57] [58] Solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. \nUsing thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base-load needs. [59] A 2013 study by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that utility-scale solar power plants directly disturb an average of 2.7 to 2.9 acres per gigawatt-hour/year, and use from 3.5 to 3.8 acres per gW-hr/year for the entire sites. \nAccording to a 2009 study, this intensity of land use is less than that of the country's average power plant using surface-mined coal. [60] Some of the land in the eastern portion of the Mojave Desert is to be preserved, but the solar industry is more interested in areas of the western desert, \"where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines\". [61] Some of the largest solar thermal power plants in the United States are in the south-west of the country, especially in the Mojave Desert . Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert commissioned between 1984 and 1991. [8] The installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity. \nThe facility has a total of 400,000 mirrors and covers 1,000 acres (4 km 2 ).\nThe plants have a total generating capacity of 354 MW. [8] Nevada Solar One generates 64MW of power and in Boulder City , Nevada , and was built by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Solargenix Energy. Nevada Solar One started producing electricity in June 2007.\nNevada Solar One uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators , heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers. These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel.  About 19,300 of these 4 metre long tubes are used in the newly built power plant. Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts.  This energy can then be drawn on at night. [62] The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is a 392 megawatt (MW) solar power facility which is located in south-eastern California. [63] The facility formally opened on February 13, 2014. [64] The Solana Generating Station is a 280 MW solar power plant which is near Gila Bend , Arizona , about 70 miles (110 km) southwest of Phoenix . The 250MW Mojave Solar Project is located near Barstow, California . The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project is a 110 megawatt (MW) solar thermal power project near Tonopah , about 190 miles (310 km) northwest of Las Vegas . [65]",

Motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford , DaimlerChrysler , and GM are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million E85-compatible vehicles on the road. [70] Ninety-five percent of gasoline sold in the U.S.(2016) is blended with 10% ethanol. [71] There are challenges in moving to higher blends, however. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 , which calls for 15.2 billion US gallons (58,000,000 m 3 ) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market. [70] The USDA in 2015 began offering grants to help gasoline retailers install blender pumps for dispensing mid-level ethanol blends. [72] The expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels. [70] On the other hand, in 2010, the biofuel industry received $6.64 billion in federal government support. [73]",
