The most important by-products are wood residues, agricultural residues and municipal/industrial waste: Wood residues are by-products from forestry operations or from the wood processing industry. Had the residues not been collected and used for bioenergy, they would have decayed (and therefore produced emissions) [g] on the forest floor or in landfills, or been burnt (and produced emissions) at the side of the road in forests or outside wood processing facilities. [24] The by-products from forestry operations are called logging residues or forest residues, and consist of tree tops, branches, stumps, damaged or dying or dead trees, irregular or bent stem sections, thinnings (small trees that are cleared away in order to help the bigger trees grow large), and trees removed to reduce wildfire risk. [h] The extraction level of logging residues differ from region to region, [i] [j] but there is an increasing interest in using this feedstock, [k] since the sustainable potential is large (15 EJ annually). [l] 68% of the total forest biomass in the EU consists of wood stems, and 32% consists of stumps, branches and tops. [25] The by-products from the wood processing industry are called wood processing residues and consist of cut offs, shavings, sawdust, bark, and black liquor. [26] Wood processing residues have a total energy content of 5.5 EJ annually. [27] Wood pellets are mainly made from wood processing residues, [m] and have a total energy content of 0.7 EJ. [n] Wood chips are made from a combination of feedstocks, [28] and have a total energy content of 0.8 EJ. [o] The energy content in agricultural residues used for energy is approximately 2 EJ. [p] However, agricultural residues has a large untapped potential. The energy content in the global production of agricultural residues has been estimated to 78 EJ annually, with the largest share from straw (51 EJ). [q] Others have estimated between 18 and 82 EJ. [r] The use of agricultural residues and waste that is both sustainable and economically feasible [12] : 9 is expected to increase to between 37 and 66 EJ in 2030. [s] Municipal waste produced 1.4 EJ and industrial waste 1.1 EJ. [29] Wood waste from cities and industry also produced 1.1 EJ. [27] The sustainable potential for wood waste has been estimated to 2–10 EJ. [30] IEA recommends a dramatic increase in waste utilization to 45 EJ annually in 2050. [31]",

[aq] Short carbon payback/parity times are produced when the most realistic no-bioenergy scenario is a traditional forestry scenario where \"good\" wood stems are harvested for lumber production, and residues are burned or left behind in the forest or in landfills. The collection of such residues provides material which \"[...] would have released its carbon (via decay or burning) back to the atmosphere anyway (over time spans defined by the biome's decay rate) [...].\" [63] In other words, payback and parity times depend on the decay speed. The decay speed depends on a.) location (because decay speed is \"[...] roughly proportional to temperature and rainfall [...]\" [64] ), and b.) the thickness of the residues. [ar] Residues decay faster in warm and wet areas, and thin residues decay faster than thick residues. Thin residues in warm and wet temperate forests therefore have the fastest decay, while thick residues in cold and dry boreal forests have the slowest decay. If the residues instead are burned in the no-bioenergy scenario, e.g. outside the factories or at roadside in the forests, emissions are instant. In this case, parity times approach zero. [as] Like other scientists, the JRC staff note the high variability in carbon accounting results, and attribute this to different methodologies. [at] In the studies examined, the JRC found carbon parity times of 0 to 400 years for stemwood harvested exclusively for bioenergy, depending on different characteristics and assumptions for both the forest/bioenergy system and the alternative fossil system, with the emission intensity of the displaced fossil fuels seen as the most important factor, followed by conversion efficiency and biomass growth rate/rotation time. Other factors relevant for the carbon parity time are the initial carbon stock and the existing harvest level; both higher initial carbon stock and higher harvest level means longer parity times. [65] Liquid biofuels have high parity times because about half of the energy content of the biomass is lost in the processing. [au]",

        "text": "EU's Joint Research Centre has examined a number of bioenergy emission estimates found in literature, and calculated greenhouse gas savings percentages for bioenergy pathways in heat production, transportation fuel production and electricity production, based on those studies. The calculations are based on the attributional LCA accounting principle. It includes all supply chain emissions, from raw material extraction, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to end-of-life treatment and final disposal. It also includes emissions related to the production of the fossil fuels used in the supply chain. It excludes emission/absorption effects that takes place outside its system boundaries, for instance market related, biogeophysical (e.g. albedo), and time-dependent effects. The authors conclude that \"[m]ost bio-based commodities release less GHG than fossil products along their supply chain; but the magnitude of GHG emissions vary greatly with logistics, type of feedstocks, land and ecosystem management, resource efficiency, and technology.\" [67] Because of the varied climate mitigation potential for different biofuel pathways, governments and organizations set up different certification schemes to ensure that biomass use is sustainable, for instance the RED (Renewable Energy Directive) in the EU and the ISO standard 13065 by the International Organization for Standardization. [68] In the US, the RFS (Renewables Fuel Standard) limit the use of traditional biofuels and defines the minimum life-cycle GHG emissions that are acceptable. Biofuels are considered traditional if they achieve up to 20% GHG emission reduction compared to the petrochemical equivalent, advanced if they save at least 50%, and cellulosic if the save more than 60%. [av] The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) states that the typical greenhouse gas emissions savings when replacing fossil fuels with wood pellets from forest residues for heat production varies between 69% and 77%, depending on transport distance: When the distance is between 0 and 2500 km, emission savings is 77%. Emission savings drop to 75% when the distance is between 2500 and 10 000 km, and to 69% when the distance is above 10 000 km. When stemwood is used, emission savings varies between 70% and 77%, depending on transport distance. When wood industry residues are used, savings varies between 79% and 87%. [aw] Since the long payback and parity times calculated for some forestry projects is seen as a non-issue for energy crops (except in the cases mentioned above), researchers instead calculate static climate mitigation potentials for these crops, using LCA-based carbon accounting methods. A particular energy crop-based bioenergy project is considered carbon positive, carbon neutral or carbon negative based on the total amount of CO 2 equivalent emissions and absorptions accumulated throughout its entire lifetime: If emissions during agriculture, processing, transport and combustion are higher than what is absorbed (and stored) by the plants, both above and below ground, during the project's lifetime, the project is carbon positive. Likewise, if total absorption is higher than total emissions, the project is carbon negative. In other words, carbon negativity is possible when net carbon accumulation more than compensates for net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO 2 . [ax] [62] : 393 There is now (2018) consensus in the scientific community that \"[...] the GHG [greenhouse gas] balance of perennial bioenergy crop cultivation will often be favourable [...]\", also when considering the implicit direct and indirect land use changes.

[62] : 367 The IPCC writes: \"While above-ground biomass carbon stocks are estimated to be declining in the tropics, they are increasing globally due to increasing stocks in temperate and boreal forests [...].\" [62] : 385 Old trees have a very high carbon absorption rate, and felling old trees means that this large potential for future carbon absorption is lost. [60] : 3 There is also a loss of soil carbon due to the harvest operations. [60] : 3 Old trees absorb more CO 2 than young trees, because of the larger leaf area in full grown trees. [73] However, the old forest (as a whole) will eventually stop absorbing CO 2 because CO 2 emissions from dead trees cancel out the remaining living trees' CO 2 absorption. [ay] The old forest (or forest stands) are also vulnerable for natural disturbances that produces CO 2 . The IPCC found that \"[...] landscapes with older forests have accumulated more carbon but their sink strength is diminishing, while landscapes with younger forests contain less carbon but they are removing CO 2 from the atmosphere at a much higher rate [...].\" [62] : 386 The IPCC states that the net climate effect from conversion of unmanaged to managed forest can be positive or negative, depending on circumstances. The carbon stock is reduced , but since managed forests grow faster than unmanaged forests, more carbon is absorbed . Positive climate effects are produced if the harvested biomass is used efficiently. [62] : 351 There is a tradeoff between the benefits of having a maximized forest carbon stock, not absorbing any more carbon, and the benefits of having a portion of that carbon stock \"unlocked\", and instead working as a renewable fossil fuel replacement tool, for instance in sectors which are difficult or expensive to decarbonize. [31] [az] The \"competition\" between locked-away and unlocked forest carbon might be won by the unlocked carbon: \"In the long term, using sustainably produced forest biomass as a substitute for carbon-intensive products and fossil fuels provides greater permanent reductions in atmospheric CO 2 than preservation does.\" [74] : 39 IEA Bioenergy writes: \"forests managed for producing sawn timber, bioenergy and other wood products can make a greater contribution to climate change mitigation than forests managed for conservation alone.\" Three reasons are given: [75] Data from FAO show that most wood pellets are produced in regions dominated by sustainably managed forests, such as Europe and North America. Europe (including Russia) produced 54% of the world's wood pellets in 2019, and the forest carbon stock in this area increased from 158.7 to 172.4 Gt between 1990 and 2020. In the EU, above-ground forest biomass increases with 1.3% per year on average, however the increase is slowing down because the forests are maturing. [76] United Kingdom Emissions Trading System allows operators of CO2 generating installations to apply zero emissions factor for the fraction used for non-energy purposes, while energy purposes (electricity generation, heating) require additional sustainability certification on the biomass used.

The boiler house is 76 m (249 ft) high, and the turbine hall is 400 m (1,300 ft) long. [40] [41] The chimney stands 259.3 m (851 ft) tall, with an overall diameter of 26 m (85 ft), [9] and weighs 44,000 tonnes. It consists of three elliptical flues of reinforced concrete , each serving two of the six boilers, set within a cylindrical 'wind shield', also of reinforced concrete. The topmost elements, the three cap rings of the flues which extend above the wind shield, are of cast iron. [9] When finished, the chimney was the largest industrial chimney in the world, and is still the tallest in the United Kingdom. [42] The chimney's dimensions, including the height, were dictated by a design total capacity of 5,100 m 3 /s of gases at 26 m/s. As the station was designed and constructed prior to the CEGB's commitment to Flue Gas Desulpurisation, extensive measures were made to limit acid attack from 'sulphurous condensate' , namely the lining of the flues with a fluoroelastomer , and coating of the upper 29 m (95 ft) of the external surfaces with a mix of acid-resisting tiles and said fluoroelastomer. [9] The twelve 114 m (374 ft) tall natural draft cooling towers stand in two groups of six to the north and south of the station. They are made of reinforced concrete, in the typical hyperboloid design, and each have a base diameter of 92 m (302 ft). [43] [44] The station was the third-largest coal-fired power station in Europe , after Bełchatów Power Station in Poland, and Neurath Power Station in Germany. It produces around 24 terawatt hours (TWh) (86.4 petajoules ) of electricity annually. Although it generates around 1,500,000 tonnes of ash and 22,800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, it is the most carbon-efficient coal-fired power plant in the United Kingdom. [45] The design life was set out in terms of number of start-ups and operating \"cycles\", but with the presumption that the station would operate as a standard 2nd-tier (nuclear stations being 1st-tier) baseload generator in the pattern well established under the centralised state-owned electricity system, it was summarised as \"in the order of 40 years\". The minimum requirement was for providing 'full load for weekdays, over a spell of 3 months'  with an availability over 85%. Weekend operations were expected to be between 50–100% of full power. Despite this intent for baseload operation, it was designed with a reasonable ability for load-following , being able to ramp up or down by 5% of full power per minute within the range of 50–100% of full power.

        "text": "In its original form, the station had a maximum potential consumption of 36,000 tonnes of coal a day. [51] In 2011, it consumed 9.1 million tonnes of coal. [52] This coal came from a mixture of both domestic and international sources, with domestic coal coming from mines in Yorkshire , the Midlands and Scotland, and foreign supplies coming from Australia, Colombia, Poland, Russia and South Africa. As of 2020, all coal was sourced internationally. [53] Fuel and other bulk commodities were supplied via a 6 mile stretch of the old Hull and Barnsley Railway line off the Wakefield and Goole railway line. Rail facilities include a west-facing junction on the Goole line, gross-weight and tare-weight weighbridges, limestone and gypsum handling facilities, including a handling building and control room for the FGD plant, FGD Sidings G and H, biomass offload (Track A), coal offload (Tracks A, B and C), bypass line (Track D), oil siding (Track E) and ash loading (Track F) and an unloading building and control room. [54] [55] When the station opened, most of the coal burned was from local collieries in Yorkshire, including Kellingley Colliery , Prince of Wales, Ackton Hall , Sharlston Colliery , Fryston Colliery , Askern Colliery and Bentley Colliery . Following the miners' strike in the mid-1980s, by 2006, all but Kellingley had closed. [56] (Kellingley closed at the end of 2015.) UK Coal had a five-year contract to supply coal, which ended at the end of 2009, from Kellingley, Maltby and, until its closure in 2007, Rossington . Coal was also brought from Harworth Colliery until it was mothballed, and was supplied by Daw Mill in Warwickshire . [57] The foreign coal was brought via various ports by rail. In c.2007 GB Railfreight won a contract to move coal brought from the Port of Tyne , celebrated by the company naming one of their locomotives Drax Power Station in 2007. [58] DB Cargo UK haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham , and from Hunterston Terminal on the west coast of Scotland . [56] [59] In 2021, all coal supplies to Drax Power Station and commercial electricity generation from coal ended [60] in accordance with the plan to end coal fired generation announced in 2020 which will see Drax transition to biomass ahead of the deadline to phase out coal from the UK energy system.

The initial trial of 14,100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby Eggborough. [62] Since the trial, the station's use of biomass has continued. It uses direct injection for firing the biomass, whereby it bypasses the pulverising mills and is either injected directly into the boiler or the fuel line, for greater throughput. [14] In 2009 a target was set for 12.5% of the station's energy to be sourced from biomass, and the shift to biomass was intended to contribute to the aim of cutting CO 2 emissions by 15%. [63] The station burns a large range of biomass, mostly wood pellets , sunflower pellets , olive , peanut shell husk and rape meal . The majority comes from overseas. [64] A 100,000 tonne pa capacity straw pelletization facility was constructed at Capitol Park, Goole in 2008, opened 2009.

[108] The station has six Babcock Power boilers, each weighing 4,000 tonnes. [14] [108] The powdered coal from ten pulverisers is blasted into each boiler through burners, which are ignited by propane . In 2003 the original burners were replaced by low nitrogen oxide burners. [51] Each of the six boilers feed steam to a steam turbine set, consisting of one high pressure (HP) turbine, one intermediate pressure (IP) turbine and three low pressure (LP) turbines. Each HP turbine generates 140 MW. Exhaust steam from them is fed back to the boiler and reheated, then fed to the 250 MW IP turbines and finally passes through the 90MW LP turbines. [14] This gives each generating set a generating capacity of 660 MW: with six generating sets, the station has a total capacity of 3,960 MW. Each of the generating units is equipped with the Advanced Plant Management System (APMS), a system developed by RWE npower and Thales , and implemented by Capula. [109] The station also has six gas turbines providing backup for breakdowns, or shut downs in the National Grid. Their annual output is generally low, generating 75 MW [44] [110] and three of the units have been mothballed and are out of operation, but they could be refurbished. [44] Emissions from these units are released through the station's second, smaller chimney, to the south of the main stack. [111] Between 2007 and 2012 the high and low pressure turbines were replaced by Siemens in a £100 million programme. [112] [113] [114] [115]",

This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide . This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO 2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, [117] sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire . [118] A byproduct of the process is gypsum , with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes to be used in the manufacture of plasterboard . [117] The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum , and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line ), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line ) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line ). [118] DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum. [119] In 2023, Drax announced a full withdrawal from using coal power past the winter contingency agreement, Drax announced that it will now embark on a decommissioning process to remove coal-related infrastructure from the site. This will commence with the removal of the flue gas desulphurisation plant that was built in the 1990s to remove 90% of the sulphur from the plant’s air emissions. [120]",

[124] In 2007 the station produced 22,160,000 tonnes of CO 2 , making it the largest single source of CO 2 in the UK. [64] [125] Between 2000 and 2007, there has been a net increase in carbon dioxide CO 2 of over 3,000,000 tonnes. [64] The station also had the highest estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides in the European Union . [126] In 2007, in a move to try to lower CO 2 emissions, Drax Group signed a £100 million contract with Siemens Power Generation to re-blade the steam turbines over four years. This is the largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in the UK, and will increase efficiency. Coupled with the co-firing of biomass , this was part of a target to reduce CO 2 emissions by 15% by 2011. [127] Drax's annual report for 2013 reported that Drax's annual emissions were at 20,612,000 tonnes of CO 2 . This was a slight decrease from 2007 levels due to the burning of biomass. [128] Drax remained the UK's largest single emitter of carbon dioxide up until 2016, when the power station claimed that its improvement programmes and conversion to burning biomass, had meant a drastic decrease in greenhouses gases being released into the atmosphere. [129] [130] Drax has opted in to the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) and thus is permitted to continue operating beyond 2015. The use of flue gas desulfurisation ensures that the limits on sulphur dioxide emissions are not exceeded. [131]",

[15] As the largest source of energy, hydropower represents the most important source of energy in the country, but after inauguration of the Reventazon Dam, the only big hydro project remaining in the planning stage by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (Costa Rican Institute of Electricity) is the El Diquís Hydroelectric Project , which has been suffering significant delays [16] due to pending environmental studies and the indigenous consultation that the state-owned company should conduct in the framework of the United Nations procedures. Costa Rica's largest dams include The Lake Arenal Dam, Lake Cachi Dam, the Rio Macho Dam, the Pirrís Dam, the Reventazón Dam and the proposed El Diquís Hydroelectric Project . The Lake Arenal Dam was built in 1979 as the first dam intended solely for hydroelectric power usage. It is located on Lake Arenal next to the famous Arenal Volcano , one of the major tourist attractions in Costa Rica. At about 33 square miles, Lake Arenal provides enough electricity to power 12% of the country. [17] The Lake Cachi, Rio Macho, and Pirrís Dams are all powered by the Rio Reventazón ( Reventazón River ) and its tributaries. The Cachi dam is situated on an artificial lake that was built in the 1970s and produces enough energy to power about 330,000 homes in Costa Rica. It also controls floods and provides recreational activities in the lake. Upstream of Cachi, the Rio Macho hydroelectric power plant has been operating since 1963 to provide hydroelectric power for central Costa Rica. [18] On the downstream, the Pirrís dam is one of the largest dams in Costa Rica and has the potential to power 160,000 homes. It also employs 3,000 Costa Ricans and provides drinking water to 40% of the metropolitan city area. The El Diquís Hydroelectric Project is a proposed hydroelectric system that Costa Rica plans to build as one of the largest Central American hydroelectric plant, located in the Southern Pacific area of the country and is intended to provide the nation with 631MW, enough energy to reach at least one million consumers. The recently opened Reventazón Dam , the current largest hydroelectric project of Central America is located on the Reventazón River, with a generation contribution of 305.5MW to the National Electric System, enough for providing electricity to more than 500,000 families.

[26] There have been a few different wind energy projects developed in the past decade. In March 2015, The Costa Rican Institute of Electricity stated that they plan on doubling the installed wind capacity in the nation by 2017. [27] As of 2011, only 2.1% of energy produced in the nation came from wind power. [28] Wind Power is primarily used in Costa Rica during the months of December to March, or the dry season. During this period, there is a general decreased rainfall in the nation and hydropower output decreases. Costa Rica finished 2015 with an additional 59 MW of power generation in wind energy, after the inauguration of the Orosi plant (50 MW) in October and “Vientos del Oeste” project (9 MW). As such, the wind power total capacity in the country is planned to grow from 194 MW in 2015 to 393 MW by 2017, an increase that would represent approximately 10.5% of total electricity production. [29] Between 1996 and 1999 the first three private wind power plants began operation and in 2002 Tejona plant, built by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad . Later, the following plants were opened: Guanacaste (private 2009), Los Santos Wind Farm (built by the public cooperative Coopesantos in 2011 in the heart of Los Santos region , in San José ), the “Valle Central”  (built by the Compañía Nacional de Fuerza y Luz, or CNFL, a Grupo ICE subsidiary in 2011) and “Chiripa” (private, 2015). In addition, the construction of five private plants during 2016 (Altamira, Campos Azules, Mogote, Vientos de la Perla y Vientos de Miramar) is planned, as well as another by the Compañía Nacional de Fuerza y Luz in 2017 (Ventus Project). Currently, there are nine large wind farms operating in Costa Rica. The Tejona Wind Power Project (TWPP) is a 19.8 MW project, fully operational since 2003, that consists of thirty wind turbines. Most recently, Tila Wind, an even larger 20-MW farm, opened in 2015. Three of the remaining eight are owned by ICE and Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz SA (CNFL) and CoopeSantos RL. The remaining five are privately owned, and nearly all of the wind power plants are in the province of Guanacaste. [27]",

        "text": "Like wind power, solar power is another newer energy source in the country. The first solar power projects in the country were established in 1978 by just a few researchers from public universities at the Solar Power Laboratory at the National University. Though still on a smaller scale and mostly privately owned, plans for larger more commercial projects are beginning to break through. [30] Despite the country has a privileged position near the equator that, combined with the sunny weather during the year, made a solar power potential of more than 144 million MWh/year, [31] solar energy in Costa Rica is in its early stages, and is even falling shorter than the rest of its Central American neighbors. According with an Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) study in 2006, the national photovoltaic potential of electric generation for the projected population for 2015 is 222,000 MWh/year. [32] In 2012, Costa Rica inaugurated the Miravalles Solar Park on the hillside of the Miravalles Volcano. At that time, it was the first of its kind in Costa Rica and the largest solar project in Central America. [33] It was built with the help of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The project's totaling was $11.5 million ($10 million from JICA and $1.5 million from ICE [34] ). This plant of 1MW only represents 0.03% of all the capacity installed in the country of 2872 MW. In 2013, China and Costa Rica signed agreements of US$30 million for financing the installation of 50 thousand solar panels, including a power plant of 10 MW. [35] In addition, in 2014, ICE announced a pilot program for solar energy use in housing that aimed to reach 600,000 clients, [36] but in 2015, the institution ended the plan arguing that the maximum capacity was already reached, rising criticism from the solar energy distributed generation sector. According with ACESOLAR, [37] more than 1000 jobs were at risk for such a decision. Differences of bureaucracy procedures and technical aspects related to the official national norm “Planeación, Operación y Acceso al Sistema Eléctrico Nacional” (POASEN, in Spanish) on introducing distributed generation have been occurring and causing delays [38] [39] in its implementation through the last years among the main actors of the solar sector: the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), the Autoridad Reguladora de Servicios Públicos (ARESEP, in Spanish, a public entity that fixes prices and standards on public services), the electricity agencies of the country and the private companies that supply solar panels. One of the main discrepancies between MINAE and ARESEP was the legal nature of net metering , being solved by the Attorney General of the Republic (Procuraduría General de la República, in Spanish) in June 2015. [40] The final resolution stated that distributed generation for self-consumption is not considered a public service in Costa Rica. In October 2015, the government finally published [41] the required regulatory framework that entered into operation in April 2016. By 2013, countries like Guatemala or Honduras have 85 MW and 388 MW of solar power capacity installed respectively, and Nicaragua and Panama are also ahead of Costa Rica with 1.4 MW and 42.7 MW, according with a report [42] released in July 2016 by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL, in Spanish). ICE's position is that the maximum capacity that could be allowed in the National Electric System is 60 MW, distributed in plants of no more than 5 MW across the territory. [43] However, the institution is not reporting to develop more solar projects in the next 10 years in their expansion plan.",

All six units would operate until 2022; two units would then shut down and four units would operate to 2024. Extending Pickering's operation will ensure a reliable, clean source of base load electricity during refurbishment of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station and the initial Bruce Nuclear refurbishments. Any plan to extend Pickering's life requires approval from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). OPG is currently working on a licence application to the CNSC for approval in 2018. On 2 December 2021, OPG announced a partnership with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to deploy a small modular reactor (SMR) at the Darlington new nuclear site, the only site in Canada currently licensed for a new nuclear build. [20] The project is expected to be completed as early as 2028.",

[33] Original plans called for a new building to be constructed in Clarington , Ontario, at the existing Darlington Energy Complex. The decision was made to retrofit the empty building for economic and sustainability reasons. [34] Clarington Mayor Adrian Foster issued a statement, saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the decision not to build in Clarington. [35] Oshawa Mayor Dan Carter welcomed the news, saying he was \"thrilled to welcome\" OPG to Oshawa. [36]",
