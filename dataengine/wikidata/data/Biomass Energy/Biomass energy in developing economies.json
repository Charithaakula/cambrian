The most important by-products are wood residues, agricultural residues and municipal/industrial waste: Wood residues are by-products from forestry operations or from the wood processing industry. Had the residues not been collected and used for bioenergy, they would have decayed (and therefore produced emissions) [g] on the forest floor or in landfills, or been burnt (and produced emissions) at the side of the road in forests or outside wood processing facilities. [24] The by-products from forestry operations are called logging residues or forest residues, and consist of tree tops, branches, stumps, damaged or dying or dead trees, irregular or bent stem sections, thinnings (small trees that are cleared away in order to help the bigger trees grow large), and trees removed to reduce wildfire risk. [h] The extraction level of logging residues differ from region to region, [i] [j] but there is an increasing interest in using this feedstock, [k] since the sustainable potential is large (15 EJ annually). [l] 68% of the total forest biomass in the EU consists of wood stems, and 32% consists of stumps, branches and tops. [25] The by-products from the wood processing industry are called wood processing residues and consist of cut offs, shavings, sawdust, bark, and black liquor. [26] Wood processing residues have a total energy content of 5.5 EJ annually. [27] Wood pellets are mainly made from wood processing residues, [m] and have a total energy content of 0.7 EJ. [n] Wood chips are made from a combination of feedstocks, [28] and have a total energy content of 0.8 EJ. [o] The energy content in agricultural residues used for energy is approximately 2 EJ. [p] However, agricultural residues has a large untapped potential. The energy content in the global production of agricultural residues has been estimated to 78 EJ annually, with the largest share from straw (51 EJ). [q] Others have estimated between 18 and 82 EJ. [r] The use of agricultural residues and waste that is both sustainable and economically feasible [12] : 9 is expected to increase to between 37 and 66 EJ in 2030. [s] Municipal waste produced 1.4 EJ and industrial waste 1.1 EJ. [29] Wood waste from cities and industry also produced 1.1 EJ. [27] The sustainable potential for wood waste has been estimated to 2–10 EJ. [30] IEA recommends a dramatic increase in waste utilization to 45 EJ annually in 2050. [31]",

[aq] Short carbon payback/parity times are produced when the most realistic no-bioenergy scenario is a traditional forestry scenario where \"good\" wood stems are harvested for lumber production, and residues are burned or left behind in the forest or in landfills. The collection of such residues provides material which \"[...] would have released its carbon (via decay or burning) back to the atmosphere anyway (over time spans defined by the biome's decay rate) [...].\" [63] In other words, payback and parity times depend on the decay speed. The decay speed depends on a.) location (because decay speed is \"[...] roughly proportional to temperature and rainfall [...]\" [64] ), and b.) the thickness of the residues. [ar] Residues decay faster in warm and wet areas, and thin residues decay faster than thick residues. Thin residues in warm and wet temperate forests therefore have the fastest decay, while thick residues in cold and dry boreal forests have the slowest decay. If the residues instead are burned in the no-bioenergy scenario, e.g. outside the factories or at roadside in the forests, emissions are instant. In this case, parity times approach zero. [as] Like other scientists, the JRC staff note the high variability in carbon accounting results, and attribute this to different methodologies. [at] In the studies examined, the JRC found carbon parity times of 0 to 400 years for stemwood harvested exclusively for bioenergy, depending on different characteristics and assumptions for both the forest/bioenergy system and the alternative fossil system, with the emission intensity of the displaced fossil fuels seen as the most important factor, followed by conversion efficiency and biomass growth rate/rotation time. Other factors relevant for the carbon parity time are the initial carbon stock and the existing harvest level; both higher initial carbon stock and higher harvest level means longer parity times. [65] Liquid biofuels have high parity times because about half of the energy content of the biomass is lost in the processing. [au]",

        "text": "EU's Joint Research Centre has examined a number of bioenergy emission estimates found in literature, and calculated greenhouse gas savings percentages for bioenergy pathways in heat production, transportation fuel production and electricity production, based on those studies. The calculations are based on the attributional LCA accounting principle. It includes all supply chain emissions, from raw material extraction, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to end-of-life treatment and final disposal. It also includes emissions related to the production of the fossil fuels used in the supply chain. It excludes emission/absorption effects that takes place outside its system boundaries, for instance market related, biogeophysical (e.g. albedo), and time-dependent effects. The authors conclude that \"[m]ost bio-based commodities release less GHG than fossil products along their supply chain; but the magnitude of GHG emissions vary greatly with logistics, type of feedstocks, land and ecosystem management, resource efficiency, and technology.\" [67] Because of the varied climate mitigation potential for different biofuel pathways, governments and organizations set up different certification schemes to ensure that biomass use is sustainable, for instance the RED (Renewable Energy Directive) in the EU and the ISO standard 13065 by the International Organization for Standardization. [68] In the US, the RFS (Renewables Fuel Standard) limit the use of traditional biofuels and defines the minimum life-cycle GHG emissions that are acceptable. Biofuels are considered traditional if they achieve up to 20% GHG emission reduction compared to the petrochemical equivalent, advanced if they save at least 50%, and cellulosic if the save more than 60%. [av] The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) states that the typical greenhouse gas emissions savings when replacing fossil fuels with wood pellets from forest residues for heat production varies between 69% and 77%, depending on transport distance: When the distance is between 0 and 2500 km, emission savings is 77%. Emission savings drop to 75% when the distance is between 2500 and 10 000 km, and to 69% when the distance is above 10 000 km. When stemwood is used, emission savings varies between 70% and 77%, depending on transport distance. When wood industry residues are used, savings varies between 79% and 87%. [aw] Since the long payback and parity times calculated for some forestry projects is seen as a non-issue for energy crops (except in the cases mentioned above), researchers instead calculate static climate mitigation potentials for these crops, using LCA-based carbon accounting methods. A particular energy crop-based bioenergy project is considered carbon positive, carbon neutral or carbon negative based on the total amount of CO 2 equivalent emissions and absorptions accumulated throughout its entire lifetime: If emissions during agriculture, processing, transport and combustion are higher than what is absorbed (and stored) by the plants, both above and below ground, during the project's lifetime, the project is carbon positive. Likewise, if total absorption is higher than total emissions, the project is carbon negative. In other words, carbon negativity is possible when net carbon accumulation more than compensates for net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling helps the soil microbe populations to decompose the available carbon, producing CO 2 . [ax] [62] : 393 There is now (2018) consensus in the scientific community that \"[...] the GHG [greenhouse gas] balance of perennial bioenergy crop cultivation will often be favourable [...]\", also when considering the implicit direct and indirect land use changes.

[62] : 367 The IPCC writes: \"While above-ground biomass carbon stocks are estimated to be declining in the tropics, they are increasing globally due to increasing stocks in temperate and boreal forests [...].\" [62] : 385 Old trees have a very high carbon absorption rate, and felling old trees means that this large potential for future carbon absorption is lost. [60] : 3 There is also a loss of soil carbon due to the harvest operations. [60] : 3 Old trees absorb more CO 2 than young trees, because of the larger leaf area in full grown trees. [73] However, the old forest (as a whole) will eventually stop absorbing CO 2 because CO 2 emissions from dead trees cancel out the remaining living trees' CO 2 absorption. [ay] The old forest (or forest stands) are also vulnerable for natural disturbances that produces CO 2 . The IPCC found that \"[...] landscapes with older forests have accumulated more carbon but their sink strength is diminishing, while landscapes with younger forests contain less carbon but they are removing CO 2 from the atmosphere at a much higher rate [...].\" [62] : 386 The IPCC states that the net climate effect from conversion of unmanaged to managed forest can be positive or negative, depending on circumstances. The carbon stock is reduced , but since managed forests grow faster than unmanaged forests, more carbon is absorbed . Positive climate effects are produced if the harvested biomass is used efficiently. [62] : 351 There is a tradeoff between the benefits of having a maximized forest carbon stock, not absorbing any more carbon, and the benefits of having a portion of that carbon stock \"unlocked\", and instead working as a renewable fossil fuel replacement tool, for instance in sectors which are difficult or expensive to decarbonize. [31] [az] The \"competition\" between locked-away and unlocked forest carbon might be won by the unlocked carbon: \"In the long term, using sustainably produced forest biomass as a substitute for carbon-intensive products and fossil fuels provides greater permanent reductions in atmospheric CO 2 than preservation does.\" [74] : 39 IEA Bioenergy writes: \"forests managed for producing sawn timber, bioenergy and other wood products can make a greater contribution to climate change mitigation than forests managed for conservation alone.\" Three reasons are given: [75] Data from FAO show that most wood pellets are produced in regions dominated by sustainably managed forests, such as Europe and North America. Europe (including Russia) produced 54% of the world's wood pellets in 2019, and the forest carbon stock in this area increased from 158.7 to 172.4 Gt between 1990 and 2020. In the EU, above-ground forest biomass increases with 1.3% per year on average, however the increase is slowing down because the forests are maturing. [76] United Kingdom Emissions Trading System allows operators of CO2 generating installations to apply zero emissions factor for the fraction used for non-energy purposes, while energy purposes (electricity generation, heating) require additional sustainability certification on the biomass used.

In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments.

[60] PV has several advantages that make it by far the fastest-growing renewable energy technology. It is cheap, low-maintenance and scalable; adding to an existing PV installation as demanded arises is simple. Its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather. [12] PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station . [61] A household's solar panels can either be used for just that household or, if connected to an electrical grid, can be aggregated with millions of others. [62] The first utility-scale solar power plant was built in 1982 in Hesperia, California by ARCO . [63] The plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later. [64] However, over the following decades, PV cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper. [65] As a result, PV adoption has grown exponentially since 2010. [66] Global capacity increased from 230 GW at the end of 2015 to 890 GW in 2021. [67] PV grew fastest in China between 2016 and 2021, adding 560 GW, more than all advanced economies combined.

        "text": "Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC. Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps. Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy. [82] There are many forms of water energy: Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar. [86] In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,360 GW. [68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol. Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 [98] and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention . Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

[259] Although protests against new wind farms occasionally occur around the world, regional and national surveys generally find broad support for both solar and wind power. [260] [261] [262] Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms. [263] A 2011 UK Government document stated that \"projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake.\" [264] In the 2000s and early 2010s, many renewable projects in Germany, Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities, particularly through cooperative structures. [265] [266] In the years since, more installations in Germany have been undertaken by large companies, [263] but community ownership remains strong in Denmark. [267]",

        "text": "In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and distributed energy options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households\nmodern energy services. [8] Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. [9] Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source. [10] Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about global warming and air pollution , reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability. [9] In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort. [8]",

Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. [12] In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass. [5] Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. [13] An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. [14] Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. [15] Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them. [14]",

The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by Japan . Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost. [22] Compared with neighboring Asian developing countries, the Philippines has relatively higher electricity prices due to the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, no government subsidy on electricity generation, fully cost-reflective, monopolized, and heavily taxed across the supply chain. [23] [24] The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. The Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy [25] and was the first Southeast Asian nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies. [22] Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030. [22] [26] Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future. [27] Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.

There is an association between low income and high population growth. [31] The development of a country is measured with statistical indices such as income per capita (per person), gross domestic product per capita, life expectancy , the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the Human Development Index (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set Millennium Development Goals from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth. [32] These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals . The concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations – for example, theories of decolonization , liberation theology , Marxism , anti-imperialism , modernization , social change and political economy . Another important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the secondary sector ( manufacturing ) have grown substantially. Similarly, countries with a tertiary sector stronghold also see a greater rate of economic development .",

[57] The West benefited significantly from this system, but left developing countries undeveloped. This arrangement is sometimes called neocolonialism , meaning a system in which less-developed countries are taken advantage of by developed countries. It does not necessarily mean that former colonies are still controlled by their former colonizer; it refers to colonial-like exploitation. Developing countries are often helping further develop rich countries, rather than being developed themselves. [58] Several institutions have been established with the goal of putting an end to this system. [59] One of these institutions is the New International Economic Order . They have a 'no-strings-attached' policy that promotes developing countries remaining or becoming self-sufficient. More specifically, they advocate sovereignty over natural resources and industrialization. Coalitions of developing nations, like the NIEO, frequently lobby for parity in the world stage.

Marriage by abduction is found in Ethiopia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. Abuse related to payment of bride price (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. [71] [72] Female genital mutilation (FGM) is another form of violence against women which is still occurring in many developing countries. It is found mostly in Africa, and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. Developing countries with the highest rate of women who have been cut are Somalia (with 98% of women affected), Guinea (96%), Djibouti (93%), Egypt (91%), Eritrea (89%), Mali (89%), Sierra Leone (88%), Sudan (88%), Gambia (76%), Burkina Faso (76%), and Ethiopia (74%). [73] Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK. [74] The Istanbul Convention prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38). [75] As of 2016, FGM has been legally banned in many African countries. [76] According to UN Women facts and figures on ending violence against women , [77] it is estimated that 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and sexual violence by intimate partners or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment ) at some point in their lives. Evidence shows women who have had experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV , compared to women who have not had experienced any physical or sexual violence. [77] Data from the Middle East and North Africa shows that men who witnessed their fathers against their mothers, and men who experienced some form of violence as children, more likely have reported perpetrating intimate partner violence in their adult relationships.

[9] [10] [11] The burden of infectious diseases, [12] maternal mortality , [13] [14] child mortality [15] and infant mortality [16] [17] are typically substantially higher in those countries. Developing countries also have less access to medical health services generally, [78] and are less likely to have the resources to purchase, produce and administer vaccines , even though vaccine equity worldwide is important to combatting pandemics , such as the COVID-19 pandemic . [79] Undernutrition is more common in developing countries. [80] Certain groups have higher rates of undernutrition, including women – in particular while pregnant or breastfeeding – children under five years of age, and the elderly. Malnutrition in children and stunted growth of children is the cause for more than 200 million children under five years of age in developing countries not reaching their developmental potential. [81] About 165 million children were estimated to have stunted growth from malnutrition in 2013. [82] In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.

Small-scale renewable energy technologies and distributed energy options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households modern energy services. [90] Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. [91] Renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.

It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases, [94] [95] and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily. [95] India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness (including waterborne diseases ) every day. [96] About 90 percent of the water in the cities of China is polluted. [97] As of 2007, half a billion Chinese had no access to safe drinking water. [98] However, after a series of reforms, China's environment began to demonstrate enormous improvements around the 2010s. Under the leadership of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping , a sizable fraction of high-pollution industries have been gradually phased out and many illegally polluting factories were sanctioned or closed. A considerable amount of effort went to enforce environmental regulations at regional levels and holding persons of malpractice accountable, including officials and firm managers. The slogan \" clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver mountains \" proposed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2005 [99] signifies China's determination in amending environmental burdens created during industrialization while shifting to more sustainable modes of development and adopting high-end industries. Water bodies around the country are much cleaner than a decade ago and steadily approaching natural levels in pollutants. In 2021, China introduced the \"coal to gas\" policy [100] as one of many policies directed towards achieving peak carbon emissions in 2060. Coal combustion in homes, power stations and production industries constitutes 60% of total energy consumption in China and is the main source of water and air pollution. It is speculated that pollution sources will be progressively eliminated as China reaches the upper tiers of developing countries.

[107] The effects of climate change will be felt around the globe and will result in events such as extreme weather events , droughts, floods, biodiversity loss , disease and sea level rise , which are dangerous for societies and the environment. [108] Although 79% of carbon emissions are produced by developed countries, [109] and developing countries have not been the major cause of climate change, [107] they are the most at risk from the effects of these changes and may face challenges in adapting to climate change due to the intersecting issues of high climate vulnerability, low economic status, [110] restricted access to technology, failing infrastructure and limited access to financial resources. Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called \"highly climate vulnerable\" [ citation needed ] . This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States [ citation needed ] . In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term \"forced riders\" as opposed to the \"free riders\" has been used as a descriptor. [18] [111] Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. [111] Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012. Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss , and economic stress. [108] [18] A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries. [112] : 17 These effects are most severe for the world's poorest countries. Internationally there is recognition of the mismatch between those that have caused climate change and those which will suffer the most from climate change, termed \" climate justice \". It has been a topic for discussion at some of the United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP). \"When we think about livelihoods at risk from climate change impacts, we know that people living in developing countries, and especially the least-developed countries and small island states, often have the least financial resources to adapt,\" says Nancy Saich, the European Investment Bank 's chief climate change expert.

They have heavily relied on traditional biomass such as wood fuel , charcoal , crop residual, and wood pellets .  Although some developing countries like the BRICS have neared the energy-related technological level of developed countries and have financial power, most developing countries are still dominated by traditional biomass. According to the International Energy Agency , \"use of traditional biomass will decrease in many countries, but is likely to increase in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa alongside population growth.\" [6] An energy ladder shows the improvement of energy use corresponding to an increase in the household income. Basically, as income increases, the energy types used by households would be cleaner and more efficient but more expensive as moving from traditional biomass to electricity. \"Households at lower levels of income and development tend to be at the bottom of the energy ladder, using fuel that is cheap and locally available but not very clean nor efficient. According to the World Health Organization, over three billion people worldwide are at these lower rungs, depending on biomass fuels—crop waste, dung, wood, leaves, etc.—and coal to meet their energy needs. A disproportionate number of these individuals reside in Asia and Africa: 95% of the population in Afghanistan uses these fuels, 95% in Chad, 87% in Ghana, 82% in India, 80% in China, and so forth. As incomes rise, we would expect that households would substitute to higher-quality fuel choices. However, this process has been quite slow. In fact, the World Bank reports that the use of biomass for all energy sources has remained constant at about 25% since 1975.\" [7]",

These requirements can change from country to country and region to region. The most common needs are lighting, cooking energy , domestic heating or cooling. [9] Other authors consider different categories of energy needs from \"fundamental energy needs\" associated to human survival and extremely poor situations. \"Basic energy needs\" required for attaining basic living standards, which includes all the functions in the previous (cooking, heating and lighting) and, in addition energy to provide basic services linked to health, education and communications. \"Energy needs for productive uses\" when additionally basic energy needs the user requires energy to make a living; and finally \"Energy for recreation\", when the user has fulfilled the previous categories and needs energy for enjoyment.\" [10] Until recently energy poverty definitions took only the minimum energy quantity required into consideration when defining energy poverty, but a different school of thought is that not only energy quantity but the quality and cleanliness of the energy used [11] should be taken into consideration when defining energy poverty. One such definition reads as: An 'improved energy source' for cooking is one which requires less than 4 hours person per week per household to collect fuel, meets the recommendations WHO for air quality (maximum concentration of CO of 30 mg/M3 for 24 hours periods and less than 10 mg/ M3 for periods 8 hours of exposure), and the overall conversion efficiency is higher than 25%. \" [12]",

[20] Additionally, having consistent access to energy means that girl children, who are usually responsible for collecting fuel for their household, have more time to focus on their studies and attend school. [20] Ninety percent of children in Sub-Saharan Africa go to primary schools that lack electricity. In Burundi and Guinea, only 2% of schools are electrified, while in DR Congo there is only 8% school electrification for a population of 75.5 million. [23] In the DRC alone, by these statistics, there are almost 30 million children attending school without power. [23] Education is a key component in growing human capital which in turn facilitates economic growth by enabling people to be more productive workers in the economy.

        "section": "Global North",
        "text": "Energy poverty is most commonly discussed as fuel poverty in the Global North where discourse is focused on households' access to energy sources to heat, cool, and power their homes. Fuel poverty is driven by high energy costs, low household incomes, and inefficient appliances (a global perspective). Additionally, older people are more vulnerable to experiencing fuel poverty because of their income status and lack of access to energy-saving technologies. [32] According to the European Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency (EPEE), approximately 50-125 million people live in fuel poverty. [33] Like energy poverty, fuel poverty is hard to define and measure because of its many nuances. The United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, are one of the few countries which have defined fuel poverty to be if 10% of a household's income is spent on heating/cooling. [34] The British New Economics Foundation has proposed a National Energy Guarantee (NEG) to lower and fix prices on essential energy. [35] [36] Another EPEE project found that 1 in 7 households in Europe were on the margins of fuel poverty by using three indicators of checking for leaky roofs, arrears on utility bills, ability to pay for adequate heating, mold in windows. [37] High energy prices, insufficient insulation in dwellings, [38] and low incomes contribute to increased vulnerability to fuel poverty. Climate change adds more pressure as weather events become colder and hotter, thereby increasing demand for fuel to cool and heat the home. The ability to provide adequate heating during cold weather has implications for people's health as cold weather can be an antagonistic factor to cardiovascular and respiratory illness. [39] Brenda Boardman 's book, Fuel Poverty: From Cold Homes to Affordable Warmth (1991) motivated the need to develop public policy to address energy poverty and also study its causes, symptoms, and effects in society. When energy poverty was first introduced in Boardman's book, energy poverty was described as not having enough power to heat and cool homes. Today, energy poverty is understood to be the result of complex systemic inequalities which create barriers to access modern energy at an affordable price. Energy poverty is challenging to measure and thus analyze because it is privately experienced within households, specific to cultural contexts, and dynamically changes depending on the time and space.

Oftentimes linked to socioeconomic cleavages , energy poverty within LAC still exposes more than 80 million people to respiratory illnesses and diseases for relying on fuels like charcoal to cook. [54] According to the United Nations, urban energy poverty in Latin America has nearly doubled in the last two decades. [55] Growing rates of urbanization and industrialization in Buenos Aires, Argentina,  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Caracas, Venezuela have exacerbated the regions' high energy losses, increased inefficient energy use, and increased political opportunism on marginalized groups affected by urban poverty. [55] The case for analyzing energy poverty in Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela has been critical in understanding the context of energy access within urban areas and the challenges within the context of global development. [55] The widespread increase in energy across Latin America does not have a uniform solution. In fact, different efforts and legislation to increase energy accessibility have had opposing effects in different Latin American countries. [56] In Venezuela, for instance, public attitude supports the free supply of energy across the nation while in Brazil, the public is willing to pay as long as the government passes reforms for the affordability of energy services. [55] Although there has been a recent increase in studies related to energy poverty in Latin America, there have not been many studies and data in the past on the prevalence of energy poverty in many Latin American countries with different climatic areas. [18] For instance, studies in Mexico in 2022 determined that 66 percent of households suffered from energy poverty, with 38 percent of the cases being due to accessibility, and 34 percent due to affordability.

[26] This proportion has grown from just 7.7% in 2001, although the trend is sometimes obscured by large yearly variations in hydroelectric power generation. Most of the growth since 2001 can be seen in the expansion of wind generated power, and more recently, in the growth in solar generated power. Renewable energy in California is prominent, with around 29% of electricity coming from RPS -eligible renewable sources (including hydropower). [27] The United States has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, with the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation's energy demand. \nA quarter of the country's land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal. [28] Many of the new technologies that harness renewables—including wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels—are, or soon will be, economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85% of United States energy needs. Dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies. [28] Wind power and solar power are becoming increasingly important relative to the older and more established hydroelectric power source. By 2016 wind power covered 37.23% of total renewable electricity production against 43.62% for hydroelectric power. The remaining share of power was generated by biomass at 10.27%, solar power at 6.03% and geothermal with 2.86% of total renewable generation. In 2015, Georgetown, Texas became one of the first American cities to be powered entirely by renewable energy, choosing to do so for financial stability reasons. [29] The United States consumed about 4,000 TWh of electricity in 2012, and about 30,000 TWh (98 quadrillion BTU) of primary energy. Efficiency improvements are expected to reduce usage to 15,000 TWh by 2050.",

Wind power overtook hydroelectric as the largest source of renewable electricity generation in 2019, and accounted for 10.25% of the country's total electricity generation by in 2022. [34] Wind and solar accounted for two-thirds of new energy installations in the United States in 2015. [35] United States wind power installed capacity exceeds 141 GW as of 2023. [2] This capacity is exceeded only by China . The 1550MW Alta Wind Energy Center is the largest wind farm in the United States and the second largest in the world behind the Gansu Wind Farm . [36] There were 90,000 wind operations jobs in the United States in 2015. \nThe wind industry in the United States generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity. [37] Wind projects boost local tax bases, and revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land. [33] GE Energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer. [33] In 2013, wind power received $5.936 billion in federal funding, which is 37% of all federal funding for electricity generation. [38] The United States has the potential of installing 10 terawatt (TW) of onshore wind power and 4 TW of offshore wind. [39] The U.S. Department of Energy's report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20% of all the country's electricity, which included a contribution of 4% from offshore wind power . [37] Additional transmission lines will need to be added, to bring power from windy states to the rest of the country. [40] In August 2011, a coalition of 24 governors asked the Obama administration to provide a more favorable business climate for the development of wind power. [41] Wind power has particularly surged, with Colorado producing 16,000 GWh in 2023, a testament to the state's investment in this clean energy source. [42]",

Solar Star is a 579 megawatt (MW AC ) farm near Rosamond, California . Completed in June 2015, it uses 1.7 million solar panels, spread over 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi). [49] [50] [51] The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW solar power plant in Riverside County, California , that uses thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar . [52] The Topaz Solar Farm is a 550 MW photovoltaic power plant, in San Luis Obispo County, California . [53] The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 485 MW photovoltaic station planned for Riverside County, California . Many schools and businesses have building-integrated photovoltaic solar panels on their roof. Most of these are grid connected and use net metering laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime. New Jersey leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. [54] California decided that it is not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff . Washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. [55] By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage. Tesla and a handful of other companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale grid energy storage including very large batteries. Beginning with the 2014 data year,  Energy Information Administration has estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation and distributed solar photovoltaic capacity.

        "text": "At the end of 2016 there were 1.76 GW total installed capacity of solar thermal power across the United States. [2] Solar thermal power is generally utility-scale.\nPrior to 2012, in six southwestern states, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah, the US Bureau of Land Management owned nearly 98 million acres (400,000 km 2 ), an area larger than the state of Montana, that was open to proposals for solar power installations. \nTo streamline consideration of applications, the BLM produced a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). In October 2012, the BLM withdrew 78% of its land from possible solar development, leaving 19 million acres (77,000 km 2 ) still open to applications for solar installations, an area nearly as large as South Carolina. Of the area left open to solar proposals, the BLM has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls Solar Energy Zones. [56] [57] [58] Solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. \nUsing thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base-load needs. [59] A 2013 study by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that utility-scale solar power plants directly disturb an average of 2.7 to 2.9 acres per gigawatt-hour/year, and use from 3.5 to 3.8 acres per gW-hr/year for the entire sites. \nAccording to a 2009 study, this intensity of land use is less than that of the country's average power plant using surface-mined coal. [60] Some of the land in the eastern portion of the Mojave Desert is to be preserved, but the solar industry is more interested in areas of the western desert, \"where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines\". [61] Some of the largest solar thermal power plants in the United States are in the south-west of the country, especially in the Mojave Desert . Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert commissioned between 1984 and 1991. [8] The installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity. \nThe facility has a total of 400,000 mirrors and covers 1,000 acres (4 km 2 ).\nThe plants have a total generating capacity of 354 MW. [8] Nevada Solar One generates 64MW of power and in Boulder City , Nevada , and was built by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Solargenix Energy. Nevada Solar One started producing electricity in June 2007.\nNevada Solar One uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators , heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers. These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel.  About 19,300 of these 4 metre long tubes are used in the newly built power plant. Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts.  This energy can then be drawn on at night. [62] The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is a 392 megawatt (MW) solar power facility which is located in south-eastern California. [63] The facility formally opened on February 13, 2014. [64] The Solana Generating Station is a 280 MW solar power plant which is near Gila Bend , Arizona , about 70 miles (110 km) southwest of Phoenix . The 250MW Mojave Solar Project is located near Barstow, California . The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project is a 110 megawatt (MW) solar thermal power project near Tonopah , about 190 miles (310 km) northwest of Las Vegas . [65]",

Motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford , DaimlerChrysler , and GM are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million E85-compatible vehicles on the road. [70] Ninety-five percent of gasoline sold in the U.S.(2016) is blended with 10% ethanol. [71] There are challenges in moving to higher blends, however. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 , which calls for 15.2 billion US gallons (58,000,000 m 3 ) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market. [70] The USDA in 2015 began offering grants to help gasoline retailers install blender pumps for dispensing mid-level ethanol blends. [72] The expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels. [70] On the other hand, in 2010, the biofuel industry received $6.64 billion in federal government support. [73]",

A biogas-powered train, named Biogaståget Amanda (The Biogas Train Amanda), has been in service in Sweden since 2005. [35] [36] Biogas powers automobiles. In 1974, a British documentary film titled Sweet as a Nut detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine. [37] [38] In 2007, an estimated 12,000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide, mostly in Europe. [39] Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas (or air) category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal feeding operations (covered livestock lagoons). Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking, although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value.",

While countries such as Germany, Austria, Sweden and Italy are fairly advanced in their use of biogas, there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent, especially in Eastern Europe. MT-Energie is a German biogas technology company operating in the field of renewable energies . [58] Different legal frameworks, education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential. [59] Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception. [60] In February 2009, the European Biogas Association (EBA) was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA's strategy defines three priorities: establish biogas as an important part of Europe's energy mix, promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential, and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July 2013, it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe. [61]",

        "text": "Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry, the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50 kg manure per day, an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at 36 °C the technology especially applies for those living in a (sub) tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable. [79] Depending on size and location, a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US$300 to $500 in Asian countries and up to $1400 in the African context. [80] A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least 15–20 years without major problems and re-investments. For the user, biogas provides clean cooking energy, reduces indoor air pollution , and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection, especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity. [79] In developing countries, it was also determined that the use of biogas leads to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions compared with GHG emissions due to firewood. Moreover, GHG emissions of 384.1 kg CO2-eq·y−1 per animal could be prevented. [81] Energy is an important part of modern society and can serve as one of the most important indicators of socio-economic development. As much as there have been advancements in technology, even so, some three billion people, primarily in the rural areas of developing countries, continue to access their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources like firewood, crop residues and animal dung in crude traditional stoves. [82] Domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world, especially Asia. [83] Several countries in this region have embarked on large-scale programmes on domestic biogas, such as China [84] and India. The Netherlands Development Organisation , SNV, [85] supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercial-viable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market, install and service biogas plants for households. In Asia, SNV is working in Nepal, [86] Vietnam, [87] [88] Bangladesh, [89] Bhutan, Cambodia, [89] Lao PDR, [90] Pakistan [91] and Indonesia, [92] and in Africa; Rwanda, [93] Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, [94] Tanzania, [95] Uganda, Kenya, [96] Benin and Cameroon. In South Africa a prebuilt Biogas system is manufactured and sold. One key feature is that installation requires less skill and is quicker to install as the digester tank is premade plastic. [97]",

Energy production is usually classified as: Primary energy assessment by IEA follows certain rules [note 1] to ease measurement of different kinds of energy. These rules are controversial. Water and air flow energy that drives hydro and wind turbines, and sunlight that powers solar panels, are not taken as PE, which is set at the electric energy produced. But fossil and nuclear energy are set at the reaction heat, which is about three times the electric energy. This measurement difference can lead to underestimating the economic contribution of renewable energy. [16] Enerdata displays data for \"Total energy / production: Coal, Oil, Gas, Biomass, Heat and Electricity\" and for \"Renewables / % in electricity production: Renewables, non-renewables\". [4] The table lists worldwide PE and the countries producing most (76%) of that in 2021, using Enerdata. The amounts are rounded and given in million tonnes of oil equivalent per year (1 Mtoe = 11.63 TWh (3.23 megajoules ), where 1 TWh = 10 9 kWh) and % of Total. Renewable is Biomass plus Heat plus renewable percentage of Electricity production (hydro, wind, solar). Nuclear is nonrenewable percentage of Electricity production. The above-mentioned underestimation of hydro, wind and solar energy, compared to nuclear and fossil energy, applies also to Enerdata. The 2021 world total energy production of 14,800 MToe corresponds to a little over 172 PWh / year, or about 19.6 TW of power generation.",
