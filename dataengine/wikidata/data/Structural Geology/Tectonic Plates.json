Dissipation of heat from the mantle is the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. As a consequence, a powerful source generating plate motion is the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. [17]",

During the twenties of the 21st Century new proposals have come forward that divide the Earth's crust into many smaller plates, called terranes, which reflects the fact that Plate reconstructions show that the larger plates have been internally deformed and oceanic and continental plates have been fragmented over time. This has resulted in the definition of ca. 1200 terranes inside the oceanic plates, continental blocks and the mobile zones (mountainous belts) that separate them.

[40] The Pacific Plate came into existence in the Early Jurassic about 190 million years ago, [41] far from the margins of the then Paleo-Pacific Ocean. Until the Pacific Plate grew large enough to reach the margins of the ocean basin, other older plates were subducted ahead of it at the ocean basin margins. For example, subduction has been occurring at the coast of South America since the Jurassic Period more than 145 million years ago, and remnants of Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic arcs are preserved there. [42] At about 120 to 115 million years ago, the Farallon Plate was subducting under South America, North America and north-east Asia while the Izanagi Plate was subducting under east Asia. By 85 to 70 million years ago, the Izanagi Plate had moved north-eastwards and was subducting under east Asia and North America, while the Farallon Plate was subducting under South America and the Pacific Plate was subducting under east Asia. About 70 to 65 million years ago, the Farallon plate was subducting under South America, the Kula Plate was subducting under North America and north-east Asia, and the Pacific Plate was subducting under east Asia and Papua New Guinea. About 35 million years ago, the Kula and Farallon plates had been subducted and the Pacific Plate was subducting around its rim in a configuration closely resembling the outline of the present-day Ring of Fire.

An example in the Ring of Fire is the Mariana Arc in the western Pacific Ocean. If, however, oceanic lithosphere is subducted under continental lithosphere, then a volcanic continental arc forms; a Ring of Fire example is the coast of Chile. [2] The steepness of the descending plate at a subduction zone depends on the age of the oceanic lithosphere that is being subducted. The older the oceanic lithosphere being subducted, the steeper the angle of descent of the subducted slab. As the Pacific's mid-ocean ridges , which are the source of its oceanic lithosphere, are not actually in the middle of the ocean but located much closer to South America than to Asia, the oceanic lithosphere consumed at the South American subduction zones is younger and therefore subduction occurs at the South American coast at a relatively shallow angle. Older oceanic lithosphere is subducted in the western Pacific, with steeper angles of slab descent. This variation affects, for example, the location of volcanoes relative to the ocean trench, lava composition, type and severity of earthquakes, sediment accretion , and the amount of compression or tension. A spectrum of subduction zones exists between the Chilean and Mariana end members. [46] [2]",

        "text": "Chile has experienced numerous volcanic eruptions from about 90 volcanoes during the Holocene Epoch. [3] Villarrica is one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rising above the lake and town of the same name. It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andes along the Gastre Fault .  Villarrica, along with Quetrupillán and the Chilean part of Lanín , are protected within Villarrica National Park . Villarrica, with its lava of basaltic-andesitic composition, is one of only five volcanoes worldwide known to have an active lava lake within its crater. The volcano usually generates strombolian eruptions , with ejection of incandescent pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and glacier ice , as well as rainfall, often causes lahars , such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971. [61] A two-kilometre-wide ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 4 mi) postglacial caldera is located at the base of the presently active dominantly basaltic-to-andesitic cone at the northwest margin of the Pleistocene caldera. About 25 scoria cones dot Villarica's flanks. Plinian eruptions and pyroclastic flows have been produced during the Holocene from this dominantly basaltic volcano, but historical eruptions have consisted of largely mild-to-moderate explosive activity with occasional lava effusion. Lahars from the glacier-covered volcanoes have damaged towns on its flanks. The Llaima Volcano is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Chile. It is situated 82 km (51 mi) northeast of Temuco and 663 km (412 mi) southeast of Santiago , within the borders of Conguillío National Park . Llaima's activity has been documented since the 17th century, and consists of several separate episodes of moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows. Lascar is a stratovolcano and the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes. The largest eruption of Lascar took place about 26,500 years ago, and following the eruption of the Tumbres scoria flow about 9,000 years ago, activity shifted back to the eastern edifice, where three overlapping craters were formed. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from Lascar in historical time since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ash and tephra fall up to hundreds of kilometers away from the volcano. The largest eruption of Lascar in recent history took place in 1993, producing pyroclastic flows as far as 8.5 km (5 mi) northwest of the summit and ash fall in Buenos Aires , Argentina, more than 1,600 km (1,000 mi) to the southeast. Chiliques is a stratovolcano located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, immediately north of Cerro Miscanti . Laguna Lejía lies to the north of the volcano and has been dormant for at least 10,000 years, but is now showing signs of life. A January 6, 2002, nighttime thermal infrared image from ASTER revealed a hot spot in the summit crater, as well as several others along the upper flanks of the volcano's edifice, indicating new volcanic activity. Examination of an earlier nighttime thermal infrared image from May 24, 2000, showed no such hot spots. [62] Calbuco is a stratovolcano in southern Chile, located southeast of Llanquihue Lake and northwest of Chapo Lake , in Los Lagos Region . The volcano and the surrounding area are protected within Llanquihue National Reserve . It is a very explosive andesite volcano that underwent edifice collapse in the late Pleistocene , producing a volcanic debris avalanche that reached the lake.  At least nine eruptions occurred since 1837, with the latest one in 1972. One of the largest historical eruptions in southern Chile took place there in 1893–1894. Violent eruptions ejected 30 cm (12 in) bombs to distances of 8 km (5.0 mi) from the crater, accompanied by voluminous hot lahars. Strong explosions occurred in April 1917, and a lava dome formed in the crater accompanied by hot lahars. Another short explosive eruption in January 1929 also included an apparent pyroclastic flow and a lava flow. The last major eruption of Calbuco, in 1961, sent ash columns 12–15 km (7.5–9.3 mi) high and produced plumes that dispersed mainly to the southeast and two lava flows were also emitted. A minor, four-hour eruption happened on August 26, 1972. Strong fumarolic emission from the main crater was observed on August 12, 1996. Lonquimay is a stratovolocano of late-Pleistocene to dominantly Holocene age, with the shape of a truncated cone. The cone is largely andesitic, though basaltic and dacitic rocks are present. It is located in La Araucanía Region of Chile , immediately southeast of Tolhuaca volcano. Sierra Nevada and Llaima are their neighbors to the south. The snow-capped volcano lies within the protected area Malalcahuello-Nalcas .  The volcano last erupted in 1988, ending in 1990. The VEI was 3. The eruption was from a flank vent and involved lava flows and explosive eruptions. Some fatalities occurred. [63] The volcanoes in Chile are monitored by the National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN) [64] [65] Earthquake activity in Chile is related to subduction of the Nazca Plate to the east. Chile notably holds the record for the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake . More recently, a magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck central Chile on February 27, 2010 , the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcano erupted in 2011 , and a M8.2 earthquake struck northern Chile on April 1, 2014 .  The main shock was preceded by a number of moderate to large shocks and was followed by a large number of moderate to very large aftershocks, including a magnitude-7.6 event on April 2. [66]",

[70] It is the second-highest summit in the country, reaching a height of 5,897 m (19,347 ft). Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by mudflows around the volcano. In October 1999, Pichincha Volcano erupted in Quito and covered the city with several inches of ash . Prior to that, the last major eruptions were in 1553 [71] and in 1660, when about 30 cm of ash fell on the city. [72] At 5,286 m (17,343 ft), Sangay Volcano is an active stratovolcano in central Ecuador, one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and is one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity; An eruption, which started in 1934, ended in 2011. [73] More recent eruptions have occurred. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the Northern Volcanic Zone , and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's roughly 500,000-year history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake Sangay National Park , the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. Reventador is an active stratovolcano that lies in the eastern Andes of Ecuador. Since 1541, it has erupted over 25 times, with its most recent eruption starting in 2008 and, as of 2020 [update] , still ongoing, [74] but the largest historical eruption occurred in 2002. During that eruption, the plume from the volcano reached a height of 17 km ( 10 + 1 ⁄ 2 mi), and pyroclastic flows reached 7 km (4.3 mi) from the cone.  On March 30, 2007, the volcano erupted ash again, which reached a height of about 3 km (2 mi). In Ecuador, EPN monitors volcanic activity.",

Popocatépetl , lying in the eastern half of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, is the second-highest peak in Mexico after the Pico de Orizaba . It is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, having had more than 20 major eruptions since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519. The 1982 eruption of El Chichón , which killed about 2,000 people who lived near the volcano, created a 1-km-wide caldera that filled with an acidic crater lake. Before 1982, this relatively unknown volcano was heavily forested and of no greater height than adjacent nonvolcanic peaks. [76]",

        "text": "The Cascade Volcanic Arc lies in the western United States. This arc includes nearly 20 major volcanoes, among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents including numerous stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones, along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas . Volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago, but most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2 million years old, and the highest peaks are less than 100,000 years old. The arc is formed by the subduction of the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates at the Cascadia subduction zone . This is a 1,090-kilometre-long (680 mi) fault , running 80 km (50 mi) off the coast of the Pacific Northwest from northern California to Vancouver Island , British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over 10 mm (0.4 in) per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce very large earthquakes, magnitude 9.0 or greater, if rupture occurred over its whole area. When the \"locked\" zone stores energy for an earthquake, the \"transition\" zone, although somewhat plastic, can rupture. Thermal and deformation studies indicate that the locked zone is fully locked for 60 km (37 mi) down-dip from the deformation front. Further down-dip, a transition from fully locked to aseismic sliding occurs. Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, no oceanic trench is present along the continental margin in Cascadia . Instead, terranes and the accretionary wedge have been lifted up to form a series of coast ranges and exotic mountains. A high rate of sedimentation from the outflow of the three major rivers ( Fraser River , Columbia River , and Klamath River ) which cross the Cascade Range contributes to further obscuring the presence of a trench. However, in common with most other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring . When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes such as the magnitude-9 Cascadia earthquake of 1700 . Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes may have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a return time of 400 to 600 years. Also, evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake is seen, as the prime reason these earthquakes are known is through \"scars\" the tsunamis left on the coast, and through Japanese records (tsunami waves can travel across the Pacific). The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states in recorded history ( VEI = 5, 1.3 km 3 (0.3 cu mi) of material erupted), exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of California's Lassen Peak . The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens ' north slope. An earthquake at 8:32 am on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into a very hot mix of pulverized lava and older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face. Alaska is known for its seismic and volcanic activity, holding the record for the second-largest earthquake in the world, the Good Friday earthquake , and having more than 50 volcanoes which have erupted since about 1760. [77] Volcanoes are found not only in the mainland, but also in the Aleutian Islands . The United States Geological Survey and the National Earthquake Information Center monitor volcanoes and earthquakes in the United States.",

        "text": "British Columbia and Yukon are home to a region of volcanoes and volcanic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire. More than 20 volcanoes have erupted in the western Canada during the Holocene Epoch but only 6 are directly related to subduction: Bridge River Cones , Mount Cayley , Mount Garibaldi , Garibaldi Lake , Silverthrone Caldera , and Mount Meager massif . [3] Several mountains in populated areas of British Columbia are dormant volcanoes . Most of these were active during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Although none of Canada's volcanoes are currently erupting, several volcanoes, volcanic fields, and volcanic centers are considered potentially active. [78] There are hot springs at some volcanoes. Since 1975, seismic activity appears to have been associated with some volcanoes in British Columbia including the six subduction-related volcanoes as well as intraplate volcanoes such as Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field . [78] The volcanoes are grouped into five volcanic belts with different tectonic settings. The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is an area of numerous volcanoes, which are caused by continental rifting not subduction; therefore geologists often regard it as a gap in the Pacific Ring of Fire between the Cascade Volcanic Arc further south and Alaska's Aleutian Arc further north. [79] The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in southwestern British Columbia is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States (which includes Mount Baker and Mount St. Helens) and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada. [80] It formed as a result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate (a remnant of the much larger Farallon Plate ) under the North American Plate along the Cascadia subduction zone. [80] The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt includes the Bridge River Cones, Mount Cayley, Mount Fee , Mount Garibaldi, Mount Price , Mount Meager massif, the Squamish Volcanic Field, and more smaller volcanoes. The eruption styles in the belt range from effusive to explosive, with compositions from basalt to rhyolite . Morphologically, centers include calderas, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes and small isolated lava masses. Due to repeated continental and alpine glaciations, many of the volcanic deposits in the belt reflect complex interactions between magma composition, topography, and changing ice configurations. The most recent major catastrophic eruption in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt was an explosive eruption of the Mount Meager massif about 2,350 years ago. It was similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, [80] sending an ash column about 20 km into the stratosphere . [81] The Chilcotin Group is a north–south range of volcanoes in southern British Columbia running parallel to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6–10 million years ago ( Miocene ) or 2–3 million years ago (Pliocene), although with some slightly more recent eruptions (in the Pleistocene). [82] It is thought to have formed as a result of back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone. [82] Volcanoes in this belt include Mount Noel , the Clisbako Caldera Complex , Lightning Peak , Black Dome Mountain , and many lava flows. Eruptions of basaltic to rhyolitic volcanoes and hypabyssal rocks of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt in northern Vancouver Island are probably linked with the subducted margin flanked by the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates at the Cascadia subduction zone. It appears to have been active during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. However, no Holocene eruptions are known, and volcanic activity in the belt has likely ceased. The active Queen Charlotte Fault on the west coast of the Haida Gwaii , British Columbia , has generated three large earthquakes during the 20th century: a magnitude 7 event in 1929; a magnitude 8.1 in 1949 (Canada's largest recorded earthquake); and a magnitude 7.4 in 1970. [83] The Public Safety Geo-science Program at the Natural Resources Canada undertakes research to support risk reduction from the effects of space weather, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides.

Immediately offshore along the Pacific coast of the peninsula runs the 10,500-metre-deep (34,400 ft) Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, where subduction of the Pacific Plate fuels the volcanism. Several types of volcanic activity are present, including stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, Hawaiian-style fissure eruptions and geysers. Active, dormant and extinct volcanoes of Kamchatka are in two major volcanic belts. The most recent activity takes place in the eastern belt, starting in the north at the Shiveluch volcanic complex, which lies at the junction of the Aleutian and Kamchatka volcanic arcs. Just to the south is the Klyuchi volcanic group, comprising the twin volcanic cones of Kliuchevskoi and Kamen , the volcanic complexes of Tolbachik and Ushkovsky , and a number of other large stratovolcanoes. Ichinsky , the only active volcano in the central belt, is located farther to the west.

        "text": "About 10% of the world's active volcanoes are found in Japan, which lies in a zone of extreme crustal instability. They are formed by subduction of the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate . As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are not uncommon. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing some slight shaking of buildings. Major earthquakes occur infrequently; the most famous in the 20th century were: the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, in which 130,000 people died; and the Great Hanshin earthquake of January 17, 1995, in which 6,434 people died. On March 11, 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit Japan , the country's biggest ever and the fifth largest on record, according to US Geological Survey data. [87] Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from tsunamis . Mount Bandai , one of Japan's most noted volcanoes, rises above the north shore of Lake Inawashiro . Mount Bandai is formed of several overlapping stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai, constructed within a horseshoe-shaped caldera that formed about 40,000 years ago when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima debris avalanche , which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a plinian eruption . Four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a conical profile, but much of the north side of the volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a debris avalanche buried several villages and formed several large lakes. In July 1888, the north flank of Mount Bandai collapsed during an eruption quite similar to the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens. After a week of seismic activity, a large earthquake on July 15, 1888, was followed by a tremendous noise and a large explosion. Eyewitnesses heard about 15 to 20 additional explosions and observed that the last one was projected almost horizontally to the north. Mount Fuji is Japan's highest and most noted volcano, featuring heavily in Japanese culture and serving as one of the country's most popular landmarks. The modern postglacial stratovolcano is constructed above a group of overlapping volcanoes, remnants of which form irregularities on Fuji's profile. Growth of the younger Mount Fuji began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8,000 years ago, accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the younger Mount Fuji. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8,000 to 4,500 years ago, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4,500 to 3,000 years ago. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainage against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes . The last eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 ejected andesitic pumice and formed a large new crater on the east flank. Some minor volcanic activity may occur in the next few years.",

Successful predictions of the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives, but as the surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and later, lahars caused by rainwater remobilising earlier volcanic deposits, thousands of houses were destroyed. Mayon Volcano is the Philippines' most active volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped by a small summit crater. The historical eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano date back to 1616 and range from Strombolian to basaltic Plinian eruptions . Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas. Taal Volcano has had 33 recorded eruptions since 1572. A devastating eruption occurred in 1911, which claimed more than a thousand lives. The deposits of that eruption consist of a yellowish, fairly decomposed (nonjuvenile) tephra with a high sulfur content. The most recent period of activity lasted from 1965 to 1977, and was characterized by the interaction of magma with the lake water, which produced violent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions. The volcano was dormant from 1977 then showed signs of unrest since 1991 with strong seismic activity and ground-fracturing events, as well as the formation of small mud geysers on parts of the island. An eruption occurred in January 2020. Kanlaon Volcano , the most active volcano in the central Philippines, has erupted 25 times since 1866. Eruptions are typically phreatic explosions of small-to-moderate size that produce minor ash falls near the volcano. On August 10, 1996, Kanlaon erupted without warning, killing 3 persons who were among 24 mountain climbers trapped near the summit. On June 3, 2024, Mt. Kanlaon erupted, displacing more than 1,000 people.",

The earliest historically dated eruption was at Whakaari/White Island in 1826, [89] followed in 1886 by the country's largest historical eruption at Mount Tarawera .  Much of the region north of New Zealand's North Island is made up of seamounts and small islands, including 16 submarine volcanoes . In the last 1.6 million years, most of New Zealand's volcanism is from the Taupō Volcanic Zone . [90] Mount Ruapehu , at the southern end of the Taupō Volcanic Zone, is one of the most active volcanoes in New Zealand. [91] It began erupting at least 250,000 years ago. In recorded history, major eruptions have been about 50 years apart, [91] in 1895, 1945, and 1995–1996. Minor eruptions are frequent, with at least 60 since 1945. Some of the minor eruptions in the 1970s generated small ash falls and lahars that damaged ski fields. [92] Between major eruptions, a warm acidic crater lake forms, fed by melting snow. Major eruptions may completely expel the lake water. Where a major eruption has deposited a tephra dam across the lake's outlet, the dam may collapse after the lake has refilled and risen above the level of its normal outlet, the outrush of water causing a large lahar. The most notable lahar caused the Tangiwai disaster on December 24, 1953, when 151 people aboard a Wellington to Auckland express train were killed after the lahar destroyed the Tangiwai rail bridge just moments before the train was due. In 2000, the ERLAWS system was installed on the mountain to detect such a collapse and alert the relevant authorities. The Auckland volcanic field on the North Island of New Zealand has produced a diverse array of explosive craters, scoria cones, and lava flows. Currently dormant , the field is likely to erupt again within the next \"hundreds to thousands of years\", a very short timeframe in geologic terms. [93] The field contains at least 40 volcanoes, most recently active about 600 years ago at Rangitoto Island , erupting 2.3 km 3 (0.55 cu mi) of lava.",

        "text": "Earth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510 million km 2 (197 million sq mi). [12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres : by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres. Most of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361 million km 2 (139 million sq mi). [96] This vast pool of salty water is often called the world ocean , [97] [98] and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world [99] [100] or ocean world . [101] [102] Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely. [103] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean , and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust , with the shelf seas covering the shelves of the continental crust to a lesser extent. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains , seamounts , submarine volcanoes , [87] oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus , and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. [104] At Earth's polar regions , the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets , forming polar ice caps . Earth's land covers 29.2%, or 149 million km 2 (58 million sq mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses , which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia , America (landmass) , Antarctica , and Australia (landmass) . [105] [106] [107] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents . The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms . The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea , to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest . The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft). [108] Land can be covered by surface water , snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation, [109] but considerable amounts of land are ice sheets (10%, [110] not including the equally large area of land under permafrost ) [111] or deserts (33%) [112] The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. [113] [114] Earth has an estimated 16.7 million km 2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km 2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland. [115] The land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust , which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere . Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic , while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite , sediments and metamorphic rocks. [116] Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust. [117] Earth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface , and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4 km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level. Earth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism ; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil .

        "text": "Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle , the lithosphere , is divided into tectonic plates . These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries , two plates come together; at divergent boundaries , two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries , two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity , mountain-building , and oceanic trench formation can occur. [121] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere , the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates. [122] As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old. [123] [124] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma , [125] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma , indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time. [50] The seven major plates are the Pacific , North American , Eurasian , African , Antarctic , Indo-Australian , and South American . Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate , the Caribbean Plate , the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma . The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year) [126] and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a (2.0–2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year). [127]",

[136] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), [137] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi ). [138] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today. [139] [140] The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m −2 , for a global heat loss of 4.42 × 10 13 W . [141] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes , a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts . [142] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges . The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.

        "text": "The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole . The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 × 10 −5 T , with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79 × 10 22 Am 2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average). [145] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago. [146] [147] The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere . Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the day-side of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the night-side magnetosphere into a long tail. [148] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the day-side magnetosphere within the solar wind. [149] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates. [150] [151] The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, [152] and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere. [153] [154] During magnetic storms and substorms , charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere , where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora .

[156] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration , each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day. [157] [158] Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars , called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time ( UT1 ), or 23 h 56 m 4.0989 s . [2] [n 10] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23 h 56 m 4.0905 s ) . [2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms. [159] Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator , this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.

Earth's average orbital distance is about 150 million km (93 million mi), which is the basis for the astronomical unit (AU) and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon . Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days , or one sidereal year . With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1°/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian . The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance from Earth to the Moon, 384,400 km (238,900 mi), in about 3.5 hours. [3] The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month , from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole , the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise . Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic ), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses . [3] [162] The Hill sphere , or the sphere of gravitational influence , of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius. [163] [n 11] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than that of the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun. [163] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm .

        "section": "Axial tilt and seasons",
        "text": "The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° [2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles . Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. [165] Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night , and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun , where the sun remains visible all day. [166] [167] By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes , when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped. [168] The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation ; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. [169] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year . Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion . In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble . Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation. [170] Earth's annual orbit is elliptical rather than circular, and its closest approach to the Sun is called perihelion . In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates shift over time due to precession and changes to the orbit, the latter of which follows cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles . The annual change in the Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. [171] [n 12] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.

        "text": "The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial , planet-like natural satellite , with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto . [173] [174] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's. [175] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis , states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust. [40] Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this prototype could be inside the Earth. [176] [177] The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes lunar tides on Earth. [178] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking : its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. [179] As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases . [180] Due to their tidal interaction , the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 μs /yr—add up to significant changes. [181] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma ) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours. [182] The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. [183] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed. [184] [185] Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle ) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. [161] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth. [186]",

        "text": "Earth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution. Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters. The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35 × 10 18 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km 2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km 3 (320 million cu mi). [193] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi). [194] About 97.5% of the water is saline ; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water . [195] [196] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers . [197] The remaining 30% is ground water , 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land) [198] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost , water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc. [199] [200] In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice . This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers , bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface, changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms. [201] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change. [202] The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt). [203] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. [204] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. [205] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir . [206] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation . [207] The abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System . Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water. [208] Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water , with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.

[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen , 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon , and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. [210] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% [210] but averages about 1%. [3] Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land. [211] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors. [212] Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere . Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. [62] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O 2 into O 3 . The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation , permitting life on land. [213] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. [214] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect : trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane , nitrous oxide , and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F), [215] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.

        "text": "Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. [217] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. [218] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy. [219] The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. [220] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. [221] Earth receives 1361 W/m 2 of solar irradiance . [222] [223] The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator. [224] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical , temperate and polar climates. [225] Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans , the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology. [226] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. [227] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. [228] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas. [229] Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation . [219] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region. [230] The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups ( humid tropics , arid , humid middle latitudes , continental and cold polar ), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. [220] The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation. [231] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts , such as Death Valley , and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica . [232] [233]",

        "text": "The upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, [234] is usually divided into the stratosphere , mesosphere , and thermosphere . [214] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. [235] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line , defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space . [236] Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space . Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass , it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. [237] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. [238] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. [239] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere. [240]",

Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere. [241] Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event . [242] Earth's life has also over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes , which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals. [243] The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths , planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity . Earth's species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions . While freezing polar regions and high altitudes , or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life. [244] Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism . [245] Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species. [246] Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons ), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. [247] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides , tsunamis , volcanic eruptions, tornadoes , blizzards , floods, droughts, wildfires , and other calamities and disasters. [248] Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain , loss of vegetation ( overgrazing , deforestation , desertification ), loss of wildlife, species extinction , soil degradation , soil depletion and erosion . [249] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming . [250] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets , a global rise in average sea levels , increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.

Human population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s, [253] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century. [254] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa . [254] Distribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth, [255] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass , with 68% of the world's land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere. [256] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century. [257] Beyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only a few special-purpose deep underground and underwater presences and a few space stations . The human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.

In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity . [281] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. [281] The Gaia hypothesis , developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. [282] [283] [284] Images of Earth taken from space , particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect , emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility. [285] [286] In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation , [287] humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally, [288] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's environments . Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth , which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides . [289] [290] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object , one of the planets of the Solar System.

For example, some volcanoes are polygenetic with more than one period of activity during their history; other volcanoes that become extinct after erupting exactly once are monogenetic (meaning \"one life\") and such volcanoes are often grouped together in a geographical region.

Most cinder cones erupt only once and some may be found in monogenetic volcanic fields that may include other features that form when magma comes into contact with water such as maar explosion craters and tuff rings . [16] Cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. Parícutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona are examples of cinder cones. In New Mexico , Caja del Rio is a volcanic field of over 60 cinder cones. Based on satellite images, it has been suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the Solar system too; on the surface of Mars and the Moon. [17] [18] [19] [20]",

Classic examples include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mayon Volcano in the Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy. Ash produced by the explosive eruption of stratovolcanoes has historically posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations. The lavas of stratovolcanoes are higher in silica, and therefore much more viscous, than lavas from shield volcanoes. High-silica lavas also tend to contain more dissolved gas. The combination is deadly, promoting explosive eruptions that produce great quantities of ash, as well as pyroclastic surges like the one that destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre in Martinique in 1902. They are also steeper than shield volcanoes, with slopes of 30–35° compared to slopes of generally 5–10°, and their loose tephra are material for dangerous lahars . [21] Large pieces of tephra are called volcanic bombs . Big bombs can measure more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) across and weigh several tons. [22]",

Volcanic activity during the Holocene Epoch has been documented at only 119 submarine volcanoes, but there may be more than one million geologically young submarine volcanoes on the ocean floor. [27] [28] In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the deep ocean basins, the tremendous weight of the water prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, submarine eruptions can be detected by hydrophones and by the discoloration of water because of volcanic gases . Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface, due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy in water (as compared to air), which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on chemotrophs feeding on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts . In May and June 2018, a multitude of seismic signals were detected by earthquake monitoring agencies all over the world. They took the form of unusual humming sounds, and some of the signals detected in November of that year had a duration of up to 20 minutes. An oceanographic research campaign in May 2019 showed that the previously mysterious humming noises were caused by the formation of a submarine volcano off the coast of Mayotte . [29]",

Magma rich in silica is much more viscous than silica-poor magma, and silica-rich magma also tends to contain more dissolved gases. Lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions: [39] Mafic lava flows show two varieties of surface texture: ʻAʻa (pronounced [ˈʔaʔa] ) and pāhoehoe ( [paːˈho.eˈho.e] ), both Hawaiian words. ʻAʻa is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is the typical texture of cooler basalt lava flows. Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Pāhoehoe flows are sometimes observed to transition to ʻaʻa flows as they move away from the vent, but never the reverse. [53] More silicic lava flows take the form of block lava, where the flow is covered with angular, vesicle-poor blocks. Rhyolitic flows typically consist largely of obsidian . [54]",

[60] Volcanoes are informally described as erupting , active , dormant , or extinct , but the definitions of these terms are not entirely uniform amongst volcanologists. The level of activity of most volcanoes falls upon a graduated spectrum, with much overlap between categories, and does not always fit neatly into only one of these three separate categories. [61]",

[63] Many dormant volcanoes have not erupted for thousands of years, but have still shown signs that they may be likely to erupt again in the future. [64] [65] In an article justifying the re-classification of Alaska's Mount Edgecumbe volcano from \"dormant\" to \"active\", volcanologists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory pointed out that the term \"dormant\" in reference to volcanoes has been deprecated over the past few decades and that \"[t]he term \"dormant volcano\" is so little used and undefined in modern volcanology that the Encyclopedia of Volcanoes (2000) does not contain it in the glossaries or index\", [66] however the USGS still widely employs the term. Previously a volcano was often considered to be extinct if there were no written records of its activity. Such a generalisation is inconsistent with observation and deeper study, as has occurred recently with the unexpected eruption of the Chaitén volcano in 2008. [67] Modern volcanic activity monitoring techniques, and improvements in the modelling of the factors that produce eruptions, have helped the understanding of why volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time, and then become unexpectedly active again. The potential for eruptions, and their style, depend mainly upon the state of the magma storage system under the volcano, the eruption trigger mechanism and its timescale. [68] : 95 For example, the Yellowstone volcano has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and Toba of around 380,000 years. [69] Vesuvius was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its unexpected eruption of 79 CE , which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii . Accordingly, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between an extinct volcano and a dormant (inactive) one. Long volcano dormancy is known to decrease awareness. [68] : 96 Pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas, and initially not seismically monitored before its unanticipated and catastrophic eruption of 1991. Two other examples of volcanoes which were once thought to be extinct, before springing back into eruptive activity were the long-dormant Soufrière Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat , thought to be extinct until activity resumed in 1995 (turning its capital Plymouth into a ghost town ) and Fourpeaked Mountain in Alaska, which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BCE.",

Edinburgh Castle in Scotland is located atop an extinct volcano, which forms Castle Rock . Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since \"supervolcano\" calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years may be considered dormant instead of extinct. An individual volcano in a monogenetic volcanic field can be extinct but that does not mean a completely new volcano might not erupt close by with little or no warning as its field may have an active magma supply.",

        "text": "There are many different types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity: phreatic eruptions (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high- silica lava (e.g., rhyolite ), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., basalt ), sector collapses , pyroclastic flows , lahars (debris flow) and carbon dioxide emission . All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs , fumaroles , mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity. Volcanic gases can reach the stratosphere, where they form sulfuric acid aerosols that can reflect solar radiation and lower surface temperatures significantly. [72] Sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina may have caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603 . [73] Chemical reactions of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere can also damage the ozone layer , and acids such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) can fall to the ground as acid rain . Excessive fluoride salts from eruptions have poisoned livestock in Iceland on multiple occasions. [74] : 39–58 Explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles . [75] Ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft, especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. This can cause major disruptions to air travel. A volcanic winter is thought to have taken place around 70,000 years ago after the supereruption of Lake Toba on Sumatra island in Indonesia. [76] This may have created a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today. [77] Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to major extinction events, such as the End-Ordovician , Permian-Triassic , and Late Devonian mass extinctions . [78] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the \" Year Without a Summer \" because of the effect on North American and European weather. [79] The freezing winter of 1740–41, which led to widespread famine in northern Europe, may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption. [80]",

        "text": "Earth's Moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core. [91] However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as maria [92] (the darker patches seen on the Moon), rilles [93] and domes . [94] The planet Venus has a surface that is 90% basalt , indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, [95] from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons , in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. [96] However, the interpretation of the flows as ash flows has been questioned. [97] There are several extinct volcanoes on Mars , four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons , Ascraeus Mons , Hecates Tholus , Olympus Mons , and Pavonis Mons . These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years, [98] but the European Mars Express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well. [98] Jupiter 's moon Io is the most volcanically active object in the Solar System because of tidal interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur , sulfur dioxide and silicate rock, and as a result, Io is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the Solar System, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the Solar System occurred on Io. [99] Europa , the smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons , also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as cryovolcanism , and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the Solar System . [100] In 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes) on Triton , a moon of Neptune , and in 2005 the Cassini–Huygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus , a moon of Saturn . [101] [102] The ejecta may be composed of water, liquid nitrogen , ammonia , dust, or methane compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan , which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere. [103] It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar . A 2010 study of the exoplanet COROT-7b , which was detected by transit in 2009, suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.

This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County . It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross . (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant \"sister faults\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.)

Box Canyon, near the Salton Sea , contains upturned strata associated with that section of the fault. [8] The fault then runs along the southern base of the San Bernardino Mountains , crosses through the Cajon Pass and continues northwest along the northern base of the San Gabriel Mountains . These mountains are a result of movement along the San Andreas Fault and are commonly called the Transverse Range. In Palmdale , a portion of the fault is easily examined at a roadcut for the Antelope Valley Freeway . The fault continues northwest alongside the Elizabeth Lake Road to the town of Elizabeth Lake . As it passes the towns of Gorman , Tejon Pass and Frazier Park , the fault begins to bend northward, forming the \"Big Bend\". This restraining bend is thought to be where the fault locks up in Southern California , with an earthquake-recurrence interval of roughly 140–160 years. Northwest of Frazier Park, the fault runs through the Carrizo Plain , a long, treeless plain where much of the fault is plainly visible. The Elkhorn Scarp defines the fault trace along much of its length within the plain. The southern segment, which stretches from Parkfield in Monterey County all the way to the Salton Sea , is capable of an 8.1-magnitude earthquake. At its closest, this fault passes about 35 miles (56 km) to the northeast of Los Angeles. Such a large earthquake on this southern segment would kill thousands of people in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and surrounding areas, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.

        "text": "The San Andreas began to form in the mid Cenozoic about 30 Mya (million years ago). [14] At this time, a spreading center between the Pacific Plate and the Farallon Plate (which is now mostly subducted, with remnants including the Juan de Fuca Plate , Rivera Plate , Cocos Plate , and the Nazca Plate ) was beginning to reach the subduction zone off the western coast of North America. As the relative motion between the Pacific and North American Plates was different from the relative motion between the Farallon and North American Plates, the spreading ridge began to be \"subducted\", creating a new relative motion and a new style of deformation along the plate boundaries. These geological features are what are chiefly seen along San Andreas Fault. It also includes a possible driver for the deformation of the Basin and Range , separation of the Baja California Peninsula , and rotation of the Transverse Range . The main southern section of the San Andreas Fault proper has only existed for about 5 million years. [15] The first known incarnation of the southern part of the fault was Clemens Well-Fenner- San Francisquito fault zone around 22–13 Ma. This system added the San Gabriel Fault as a primary focus of movement between 10–5 Ma. Currently, it is believed that the modern San Andreas will eventually transfer its motion toward a fault within the Eastern California Shear Zone . This complicated evolution, especially along the southern segment, is mostly caused by either the \"Big Bend\" and/or a difference in the motion vector between the plates and the trend of the fault and its surrounding branches.",

        "text": "A study published in 2006 in the journal Nature by Yuri Fialko, an associate professor at the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , [21] found that the San Andreas fault has reached a sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur. [22] This study also found that the risk of a large earthquake may be increasing more rapidly than scientists had previously believed. Moreover, the risk is currently concentrated on the southern section of the fault, i.e. the region around Los Angeles, because strong earthquakes have occurred relatively recently on the central ( 1857 ) and northern ( 1906 ) segments of the fault, while the southern section has not seen any similar rupture for at least 300 years. According to this study, a major earthquake on that southern section of the San Andreas fault would result in major damage to the Palm Springs – Indio metropolitan area and other cities in San Bernardino , Riverside and Imperial counties in California, and Mexicali Municipality in Baja California . It would be strongly felt (and potentially cause significant damage) throughout much of Southern California , including densely populated areas of Los Angeles County , Ventura County , Orange County , San Diego County , Ensenada Municipality and Tijuana Municipality , Baja California , San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora and Yuma , Arizona . Older buildings would be especially prone to damage or collapse, as would buildings built on unconsolidated gravel or in coastal areas where water tables are high (and thus subject to soil liquefaction ). Of the study, Fialko stated: Nevertheless, in the 18 years since that publication there has not been a substantial quake in the Los Angeles area, and two major reports issued by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have made variable predictions as to the risk of future seismic events. The ability to predict major earthquakes with sufficient precision to warrant increased precautions has remained elusive. [23] The U.S. Geological Survey 's most recent forecast, known as UCERF3 (Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3), released in November 2013, estimated that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 M or greater (i.e. equal to or greater than the 1994 Northridge earthquake ) occurs about once every 6.7 years statewide. The same report also estimated there is a 7% probability that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or greater will occur in the next 30 years somewhere along the San Andreas Fault. [24] [ failed verification ] A different USGS study in 2008 tried to assess the physical, social and economic consequences of a major earthquake in southern California. That study predicted that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213 billion in damage. [25]",

        "section": "Subduction and plate tectonics",
        "text": "According to the theory of plate tectonics , the Earth's lithosphere , its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger tectonic plates and several smaller plates. These plates are in slow motion, due mostly to the pull force of subducting lithosphere. Sinking lithosphere at subduction zones are a part of convection cells in the underlying ductile mantle . This process of convection allows heat generated by radioactive decay to escape from the Earth's interior. [6] The lithosphere consists of the outermost light crust plus the uppermost rigid portion of the mantle . Oceanic lithosphere ranges in thickness from just a few km for young lithosphere created at mid-ocean ridges to around 100 km (62 mi) for the oldest oceanic lithosphere. [7] Continental lithosphere is up to 200 km (120 mi) thick. [8] The lithosphere is relatively cold and rigid compared with the underlying asthenosphere , and so tectonic plates move as solid bodies atop the asthenosphere. Individual plates often include both regions of the oceanic lithosphere and continental lithosphere. Subduction zones are where the cold oceanic lithosphere sinks back into the mantle and is recycled. [4] [9] They are found at convergent plate boundaries, where the oceanic lithosphere of one plate converges with the less dense lithosphere of another plate. The heavier oceanic lithosphere is overridden by the leading edge of the other plate. [7] The overridden plate (the slab ) sinks at an angle of approximately 25 to 75 degrees to Earth's surface. [10] This sinking is driven by the temperature difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere, as the colder oceanic lithosphere has, on average, a greater density. [7] Sediments and some trapped water are carried downwards by the slab and recycled into the deep mantle. [11] Earth is so far the only planet where subduction is known to occur, and subduction zones are its most important tectonic feature. Subduction is the driving force behind plate tectonics , and without it, plate tectonics could not occur. [12] Oceanic subduction zones are located along 55,000 km (34,000 mi) convergent plate margins, [13] almost equal to the cumulative plate formation rate 60,000 km (37,000 mi) of mid-ocean ridges. [14] Sea water seeps into oceanic lithosphere through fractures and pores, and reacts with minerals in the crust and mantle to form hydrous minerals (such as serpentine) that store water in their crystal structures. [15] Water is transported into the deep mantle via hydrous minerals in subducting slabs. During subduction, a series of minerals in these slabs such as serpentine can be stable at different pressures within the slab geotherms, and may transport significant amount of water into the Earth's interior. [16] As plates sink and heat up, released fluids can trigger seismicity and induce melting within the subducted plate and in the overlying mantle wedge. This type of melting selectively concentrates volatiles and transports them into the overlying plate. If an eruption occurs, the cycle then returns the volatiles into the oceans and atmosphere.

        "section": "Earthquakes and tsunamis",
        "text": "Elastic strain caused by plate convergence in subduction zones produces at least three types of earthquakes. These are deep earthquakes, megathrust earthquakes, and outer rise earthquakes. Deep earthquakes happen within the crust, megathrust earthquakes on the subduction interface near the trench, and outer rise earthquakes on the subducting lower plate as it bends near the trench. Anomalously deep events are a characteristic of subduction zones, which produce the deepest quakes on the planet. Earthquakes are generally restricted to the shallow, brittle parts of the crust, generally at depths of less than twenty kilometers. However, in subduction zones quakes occur at depths as great as 700 km (430 mi). These quakes define inclined zones of seismicity known as Wadati–Benioff zones which trace the descending slab. [70] Nine of the ten largest earthquakes of the last 100 years were subduction zone megathrust earthquakes. These included the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake which at M 9.5 was the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . The subduction of cold oceanic lithosphere into the mantle depresses the local geothermal gradient and causes a larger portion of Earth's crust to deform in a more brittle fashion than it would in a normal geothermal gradient setting. Because earthquakes can occur only when a rock is deforming in a brittle fashion, subduction zones can cause large earthquakes. If such a quake causes rapid deformation of the sea floor, there is potential for tsunamis . The largest tsunami ever recorded happened due to a mega-thrust earthquake on December 26, 2004 . The earthquake was caused by subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate under the Euro-Asian Plate, but the tsunami spread over most of the planet and devastated the areas around the Indian Ocean. Small tremors which cause small, nondamaging tsunamis, also occur frequently. [70] A study published in 2016 suggested a new parameter to determine a subduction zone's ability to generate mega-earthquakes. [71] By examining subduction zone geometry and comparing the degree of lower plate curvature of the subducting plate in great historical earthquakes such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, it was determined that the magnitude of earthquakes in subduction zones is inversely proportional to the angle of subduction near the trench, meaning that \"the flatter the contact between the two plates, the more likely it is that mega-earthquakes will occur\". [72] Outer rise earthquakes on the lower plate occur when normal faults oceanward of the subduction zone are activated by flexure of the plate as it bends into the subduction zone. [73] The 2009 Samoa earthquake is an example of this type of event. Displacement of the sea floor caused by this event generated a six-meter tsunami in nearby Samoa. Seismic tomography has helped detect subducted lithospheric slabs deep in the mantle where no earthquakes occur. [28] About one hundred slabs have been described in terms of depth and their timing and location of subduction. [74] The great seismic discontinuities in the mantle, at 410 km (250 mi) depth and 670 km (420 mi), are disrupted by the descent of cold slabs in deep subduction zones. Some subducted slabs seem to have difficulty penetrating the major discontinuity that marks the boundary between the upper mantle and lower mantle at a depth of about 670 kilometers. Other subducted oceanic plates have sunk to the core–mantle boundary at 2890 km depth. Generally, slabs decelerate during their descent into the mantle, from typically several cm/yr (up to ~10 cm/yr in some cases) at the subduction zone and in the uppermost mantle, to ~1 cm/yr in the lower mantle. [74] This leads to either folding or stacking of slabs at those depths, visible as thickened slabs in seismic tomography. Below ~1700 km, there might be a limited acceleration of slabs due to lower viscosity as a result of inferred mineral phase changes until they approach and finally stall at the core–mantle boundary . [74] Here the slabs are heated up by the ambient heat and are not detected anymore ~300 Myr after subduction. [74]",

        "text": "Over time, many theories have tried to clarify the evolution of the East African Rift. In 1972 it was proposed that the EAR was not caused by tectonic activity, but rather by differences in crustal density. Since the 1990s, evidence has been found in favor of mantle plumes beneath the EAR. [10] Others proposed an African superplume causing mantle deformation. [11] [12] [13] Although the effects of deep-rooted mantle plumes are an important hypothesis, their location and dynamics are poorly understood, and a matter of active research. [14] The question is still debated. The most recent and accepted view is the theory put forth in 2009: that magmatism and plate tectonics have a feedback with one another, controlled by oblique rifting conditions. According to this theory, lithospheric thinning generates volcanic activity, further increasing  magmatic processes such as intrusions and numerous small plumes. These processes further thin the lithosphere in saturated areas, making the thinning lithosphere behave like a mid-ocean ridge . [12] According to marine geologist Kathleen Crane , the rift could eventually cause eastern Africa to separate from the mainland, although this potential event could take tens of millions of years. [16] Studies that contribute to the broader understanding on the evolution of rifts can be grouped into the techniques of isotope geochemistry, seismic tomography and geodynamical modeling.",

The distinguishing fourth map depicts a depth below the 410 km discontinuity where Vs steeps up (getting overall bluer), but it still displays the signature of a plume at the substrate of the East African Rift. In the white box, the Vs vertical profile at 10°N, 40°E illustrates the increase of velocity with depth and the effect of the 410 km discontinuity."

The cratons are thick, and have survived for billions of years with little tectonic activity. They are characterized by greenstone belts , tonalites , and other high-grade metamorphic lithologies. The cratons are of significant importance in terms of mineral resources , with major deposits of gold, antimony, iron, chromium and nickel. [23] A large volume of continental flood basalts erupted during the Oligocene , with the majority of the volcanism coinciding with the opening of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden approximately 30 Ma. [11] [14] The composition of the volcanics are a continuum of ultra-alkaline to tholeiitic and felsic rocks. It has been suggested that the diversity of the compositions could be partially explained by different mantle source regions. The EAR also cuts through old sedimentary rocks deposited in ancient basins. [24]",

The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton , Congo Craton , Tanzania Craton and West African Craton . The cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the Pan-African orogeny and stayed together when Gondwana split up. The cratons are connected by orogenic belts , regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged. The Saharan Metacraton has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, but alternatively may consist of a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the Pan-African orogeny . In some areas, the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins , such as the Tindouf Basin , Taoudeni Basin and Congo Basin , where the underlying archaic crust is overlaid by more recent Neoproterozoic sediments. The plate includes shear zones such as the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ) where, in the past, two sections of the crust were moving in opposite directions, and rifts such as the Anza Trough where the crust was pulled apart, and the resulting depression filled with more modern sediment.",

This rift zone separates the African Plate to the west from the Somali Plate to the east. One hypothesis proposes a mantle plume rising beneath the Afar region pushing the crust outward, whereas an opposing hypothesis explains the rifting by dynamics in the crust, as a break in the African Plate along a line of maximum weakness as plates to its east move rapidly northward. The African Plate's speed is estimated at 2.15 cm (0.85 in) per year. [4] It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. It is pushing closer to the Eurasian Plate , causing subduction where oceanic crust is converging with continental crust (e.g. portions of the central and eastern Mediterranean ). In the western Mediterranean, the relative motions of the Eurasian and African plates produce a combination of lateral and compressive forces, concentrated in a zone known as the Azores–Gibraltar Fault Zone . Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea Rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate. The New England hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean has probably created a short line of mid- to late- Tertiary age seamounts on the African Plate but appears to be currently inactive. [5]",

[3] The Pacific Plate has the distinction of showing one of the largest areal sections of the oldest members of seabed geology being entrenched into eastern Asian oceanic trenches . A geologic map of the Pacific Ocean seabed shows not only the geologic sequences, and associated Ring of Fire zones on the ocean's perimeters, but the various ages of the seafloor in a stairstep fashion, youngest to oldest, the oldest being consumed into the Asian oceanic trenches. The oldest part disappearing by way of the plate tectonics cycle is early- Cretaceous (145 to 137 million years ago). [6] The Pacific Plate originated at the triple junction of the three main oceanic plates of Panthalassa , the Farallon , Phoenix , and Izanagi Plates , around 190 million years ago. The plate formed because the triple junction had converted to an unstable form surrounded on all sides by transform faults , due to the development of a kink in one of the plate boundaries. The \"Pacific Triangle\", the oldest part of the Pacific Plate, created during the initial stages of plate formation, is located just east of the Mariana Trench . [7] The growth of the Pacific Plate reduced the Farallon Plate to a few remnants along the west coast of the Americas (such as the Juan de Fuca Plate ) [8] and the Phoenix Plate to a small remnant near the Drake Passage , [9] and destroyed the Izanagi Plate by subduction under Asia.
