        "text": "Fracture mechanics was developed during World War I by English aeronautical engineer A. A. Griffith – thus the term Griffith crack – to explain the failure of brittle materials. [5] Griffith's work was motivated by two contradictory facts: A theory was needed to reconcile these conflicting observations. Also, experiments on glass fibers that Griffith himself conducted suggested that the fracture stress increases as the fiber diameter decreases. Hence the uniaxial tensile strength, which had been used extensively to predict material failure before Griffith, could not be a specimen-independent material property. Griffith suggested that the low fracture strength observed in experiments, as well as the size-dependence of strength, was due to the presence of microscopic flaws in the bulk material. To verify the flaw hypothesis, Griffith introduced an artificial flaw in his experimental glass specimens. The artificial flaw was in the form of a surface crack which was much larger than other flaws in a specimen. The experiments showed that the product of the square root of the flaw length ( a {\\displaystyle a} ) and the stress at fracture ( σ f {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{f}} ) was nearly constant, which is expressed by the equation: An explanation of this relation in terms of linear elasticity theory is problematic. Linear elasticity theory predicts that stress (and hence the strain) at the tip of a sharp flaw in a linear elastic material is infinite. To avoid that problem, Griffith developed a thermodynamic approach to explain the relation that he observed. The growth of a crack, the extension of the surfaces on either side of the crack, requires an increase in the surface energy . Griffith found an expression for the constant C {\\displaystyle C} in terms of the surface energy of the crack by solving the elasticity problem of a finite crack in an elastic plate. Briefly, the approach was: where E {\\displaystyle E} is the Young's modulus of the material and γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is the surface energy density of the material. Assuming E = 62 GPa {\\displaystyle E=62\\ {\\text{GPa}}} and γ = 1 J/m 2 {\\displaystyle \\gamma =1\\ {\\text{J/m}}^{2}} gives excellent agreement of Griffith's predicted fracture stress with experimental results for glass. For the simple case of a thin rectangular plate with a crack perpendicular to the load, the energy release rate, G {\\displaystyle G} , becomes: where σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } is the applied stress, a {\\displaystyle a} is half the crack length, and E {\\displaystyle E} is the Young's modulus , which for the case of plane strain should be divided by the plate stiffness factor ( 1 − ν 2 ) {\\displaystyle (1-\\nu ^{2})} . The strain energy release rate can physically be understood as: the rate at which energy is absorbed by growth of the crack . However, we also have that: If G {\\displaystyle G} ≥ G c {\\displaystyle G_{c}} , this is the criterion for which the crack will begin to propagate. For materials highly deformed before crack propagation, the linear elastic fracture mechanics formulation is no longer applicable and an adapted model is necessary to describe the stress and displacement field close to crack tip, such as on fracture of soft materials .",

        "text": "Griffith's theory provides excellent agreement with experimental data for brittle materials such as glass.  For ductile materials such as steel , although the relation σ f a = C {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{f}{\\sqrt {a}}=C} still holds, the surface energy ( γ ) predicted by Griffith's theory is usually unrealistically high.  A group working under G. R. Irwin [7] at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) during World War II realized that plasticity must play a significant role in the fracture of ductile materials. In ductile materials (and even in materials that appear to be brittle [8] ), a plastic zone develops at the tip of the crack.  As the applied load increases, the plastic zone increases in size until the crack grows and the elastically strained material behind the crack tip unloads. The plastic loading and unloading cycle near the crack tip leads to the dissipation of energy as heat .  Hence, a dissipative term has to be added to the energy balance relation devised by Griffith for brittle materials.  In physical terms, additional energy is needed for crack growth in ductile materials as compared to brittle materials. Irwin's strategy was to partition the energy into two parts: Then the total energy is: where γ {\\displaystyle \\gamma } is the surface energy and G p {\\displaystyle G_{p}} is the plastic dissipation (and dissipation from other sources) per unit area of crack growth. The modified version of Griffith's energy criterion can then be written as For brittle materials such as glass, the surface energy term dominates and G ≈ 2 γ = 2 J/m 2 {\\displaystyle G\\approx 2\\gamma =2\\,\\,{\\text{J/m}}^{2}} .  For ductile materials such as steel, the plastic dissipation term dominates and G ≈ G p = 1000 J/m 2 {\\displaystyle G\\approx G_{p}=1000\\,\\,{\\text{J/m}}^{2}} .  For polymers close to the glass transition temperature, we have intermediate values of G {\\displaystyle G} between 2 and 1000 J/m 2 {\\displaystyle {\\text{J/m}}^{2}} .",

One basic assumption in Irwin's linear elastic fracture mechanics is small scale yielding, the condition that the size of the plastic zone is small compared to the crack length.  However, this assumption is quite restrictive for certain types of failure in structural steels though such steels can be prone to brittle fracture, which has led to a number of catastrophic failures. Linear-elastic fracture mechanics is of limited practical use for structural steels and Fracture toughness testing can be expensive.",

As a result, the Nodal Release method (NR) can be used to determine G i {\\displaystyle G_{i}} from FEA results. The energy release rate is calculated at the nodes of the finite element mesh for the crack at an initial length and extended by a small distance Δ a {\\displaystyle \\Delta a} . First, we calculate the displacement variation at the node of interest Δ u → = u → ( t + 1 ) − u → ( t ) {\\displaystyle \\Delta {\\vec {u}}={\\vec {u}}^{(t+1)}-{\\vec {u}}^{(t)}} (before and after the crack tip node is released). Secondly, we keep track of the nodal force F → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {F}}} outputted by FEA.

Note that the equations above are derived using the crack closure integral. If the energy release rate exceeds a critical value, the crack will grow. In this case, a new FEA simulation is performed (for the next time step) where the node at the crack tip is released. For a bounded substrate, we may simply stop enforcing fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the crack tip node of the previous time step (i.e. displacements are no longer restrained). For a symmetric crack, we would need to update the geometry of the domain with a longer crack opening (and therefore generate a new mesh [5] ).",

[15] This is done by collapsing the nodes on the line ξ = − 1 {\\displaystyle \\xi =-1} to the mid-node location and shifting the mid-nodes on η = ± 1 {\\displaystyle \\eta =\\pm 1} to the quarter-point location.  The collapsed rectangle can more easily surround the crack tip but requires that the element edges be straight or the accuracy of calculating the stress intensity factor will be reduced. A better candidate for the quarter-point method is the natural triangle as seen in Figure 7. The element's geometry allows for the crack tip to be easily surrounded and meshing is simplified. Following the same procedure described above, the displacement and strain field for the triangular elements are: This method reproduces the first two terms of the Williams solutions [16] with a constant and singular term. An advantage of the quarter-point method is that it can be easily generalized to 3-dimensional models. This can greatly reduce computation when compared to other 3-dimensional methods but can lead to errors if that crack tip propagates with a large degree of curvature. [17]",

[2] This is usually determined for a given specimen by a tensile test , which charts the stress–strain curve (see image). The final recorded point is the fracture strength. Ductile materials have a fracture strength lower than the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), whereas in brittle materials the fracture strength is equivalent to the UTS. [2] If a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load-controlled situation, [Note 1] it will continue to deform, with no additional load application, until it ruptures. However, if the loading is displacement-controlled, [Note 2] the deformation of the material may relieve the load, preventing rupture. The statistics of fracture in random materials have very intriguing behavior, and was noted by the architects and engineers quite early. Indeed, fracture or breakdown studies might be the oldest physical science studies, which still remain intriguing and very much alive. Leonardo da Vinci , more than 500 years ago, observed that the tensile strengths of nominally identical specimens of iron wire decrease with increasing length of the wires (see e.g., [3] for a recent discussion). Similar observations were made by Galileo Galilei more than 400 years ago. This is the manifestation of the extreme statistics of failure (bigger sample volume can have larger defects due to cumulative fluctuations where failures nucleate and induce lower strength of the sample).

        "text": "In brittle fracture, no apparent plastic deformation takes place before fracture. Brittle fracture typically involves little energy absorption and occurs at high speeds—up to 2,133.6 m/s (7,000 ft/s) in steel. [5] In most cases brittle fracture will continue even when loading is discontinued. [6] In brittle crystalline materials, fracture can occur by cleavage as the result of tensile stress acting normal to crystallographic planes with low bonding (cleavage planes). In amorphous solids , by contrast, the lack of a crystalline structure results in a conchoidal fracture , with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension. The fracture strength (or micro-crack nucleation stress) of a material was first theoretically estimated by Alan Arnold Griffith in 1921: where: – On the other hand, a crack introduces a stress concentration modeled by Inglis's equation [7] where: Putting these two equations together gets Sharp cracks (small ρ {\\displaystyle \\rho } ) and large defects (large a {\\displaystyle a} ) both lower the fracture strength of the material. Recently, scientists have discovered supersonic fracture , the phenomenon of crack propagation faster than the speed of sound in a material. [8] This phenomenon was recently also verified by experiment of fracture in rubber-like materials. The basic sequence in a typical brittle fracture is: introduction of a flaw either before or after the material is put in service, slow and stable crack propagation under recurring loading, and sudden rapid failure when the crack reaches critical crack length based on the conditions defined by fracture mechanics. [6] Brittle fracture may be avoided by controlling three primary factors: material fracture toughness (K c ), nominal stress level (σ), and introduced flaw size (a). [5] Residual stresses, temperature, loading rate, and stress concentrations also contribute to brittle fracture by influencing the three primary factors. [5] Under certain conditions, ductile materials can exhibit brittle behavior. Rapid loading, low temperature, and triaxial stress constraint conditions may cause ductile materials to fail without prior deformation. [5]",

        "text": "In ductile fracture, extensive plastic deformation ( necking ) takes place before fracture. The terms \"rupture\" and \"ductile rupture\" describe the ultimate failure of ductile materials loaded in tension. The extensive plasticity causes the crack to propagate slowly due to the absorption of a large amount of energy before fracture. [9] [10] Because ductile rupture involves a high degree of plastic deformation, the fracture behavior of a propagating crack as modelled above changes fundamentally. Some of the energy from stress concentrations at the crack tips is dissipated by plastic deformation ahead of the crack as it propagates. The basic steps in ductile fracture are microvoid [11] formation, microvoid coalescence (also known as crack formation), crack propagation, and failure, often resulting in a cup-and-cone shaped failure surface. The microvoids nucleate at various internal discontinuities, such as precipitates, secondary phases, inclusions, and grain boundaries in the material. [11] As local stress increases the microvoids grow, coalesce and eventually form a continuous fracture surface. [11] Ductile fracture is typically transgranular and deformation due to dislocation slip can cause the shear lip characteristic of cup and cone fracture. [12] The microvoid coalescence results in a dimpled appearance on the fracture surface. The dimple shape is heavily influenced by the type of loading. Fracture under local uniaxial tensile loading usually results in formation of equiaxed dimples. Failures caused by shear will produce elongated or parabolic shaped dimples that point in opposite directions on the matching fracture surfaces. Finally, tensile tearing produces elongated dimples that point in the same direction on matching fracture surfaces. [11]",

He found that a crack subjected to any arbitrary loading could be resolved into three types of linearly independent cracking modes.

Mode II is a sliding (in-plane shear ) mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in a direction perpendicular to the leading edge of the crack. Mode III is a tearing ( antiplane shear ) mode where the crack surfaces move relative to one another and parallel to the leading edge of the crack. Mode I is the most common load type encountered in engineering design. Different subscripts are used to designate the stress intensity factor for the three different modes.  The stress intensity factor for mode I is designated K I {\\displaystyle K_{\\rm {I}}} and applied to the crack opening mode.  The mode II stress intensity factor, K I I {\\displaystyle K_{\\rm {II}}} , applies to the crack sliding mode and the mode III stress intensity factor, K I I I {\\displaystyle K_{\\rm {III}}} , applies to the tearing mode.

Hutchinson used a material constitutive law of the form suggested by W. Ramberg and W. Osgood : [9] where σ is the stress in uniaxial tension, σ y is a yield stress , ε is the strain ,  and ε y = σ y / E is the corresponding yield strain.  The quantity E is the elastic Young's modulus of the material.  The model is parametrized by α , a dimensionless constant characteristic of the material, and n , the coefficient of work hardening .  This model is applicable only to situations where the stress increases monotonically, the stress components remain approximately in the same ratios as loading progresses (proportional loading), and there is no unloading . If a far-field tensile stress σ far is applied to the body shown in the adjacent figure, the J-integral around the path Γ 1 (chosen to be completely inside the elastic zone) is given by Since the total integral around the crack vanishes and the contributions along the surface of the crack are zero, we have If the path Γ 2 is chosen such that it is inside the fully plastic domain, Hutchinson showed that where K is a stress amplitude, ( r , θ ) is a polar coordinate system with origin at the crack tip, s is a constant determined from an asymptotic expansion of the stress field around the crack, and I is a dimensionless integral.  The relation between the J-integrals around  Γ 1 and  Γ 2 leads to the constraint and an expression for K in terms of the far-field stress where β = 1 for plane stress and β = 1 − ν 2 for plane strain ( ν is the Poisson's ratio ).
