        "text": "Compared with solar xenon, Earth's atmospheric Xe is enriched in heavy isotopes by 3 to 4% per atomic mass unit (amu). [18] However, the total abundance of xenon gas is depleted by one order of magnitude relative to other noble gases. [15] The elemental depletion while relative enrichment in heavy isotopes is called the \" Xenon paradox \". A possible explanation is that some processes can specifically diminish xenon rather than other light noble gases (e.g. Krypton ) and preferentially remove lighter Xe isotopes. In the last 2 decades, two categories of models have been proposed to solve the xenon paradox. The first assumes that the Earth accreted from porous planetesimals, and isotope fractionation happened due to gravitational separation. [19] However, this model cannot reproduce the abundance and isotopic composition of light noble gases in the atmosphere. The second category supposes a massive impact resulted in an aerodynamic drag on heavier gases. [20] Both the aerodynamic drag and the downward gravitational effect lead to a mass-dependent loss of Xe gases. But following research suggested that Xe isotope mass fractionation shouldn't be a rapid, single event. [21] Research published since 2018 on noble gases preserved in Archean (3.5–3.0 Ga old) samples may provide a solution to the Xe paradox. [21] [22] Isotopically mass fractionated Xe is found in tiny inclusions of ancient seawater in Archean barite [23] and hydrothermal quartz. [24] The distribution of Xe isotopes lies between the primordial solar and the modern atmospheric Xe isotope patterns. The isotopic fractionation gradually increases relative to the solar distribution as Earth evolves over its first 2 billion years. [21] This two billion-year history of evolving Xe fractionation coincides with early solar system conditions including high solar extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) radiation [15] [25] [26] and large impacts that could energize large rates of hydrogen escape to space that are big enough to drag out xenon. However, models of neutral xenon atoms escaping cannot resolve the problem that other lighter noble gas elements don't show the signal of depletion or mass-dependent fractionation . For example, because Kr is lighter than Xe, Kr should also have escaped in a neutral wind. Yet the isotopic distribution of atmospheric Kr on Earth is significantly less fractionated than atmospheric Xe. [16] A current explanation [28] [29] is that hydrodynamic escape can preferentially remove lighter atmospheric species and lighter isotopes of Xe in the form of charged ions instead of neutral atoms. Hydrogen is liberated from hydrogen-bearing gases (H 2 or CH 4 ) by photolysis in the early Earth atmosphere. Hydrogen is light and can be abundant at the top of the atmosphere and escape. In the polar regions where there are open magnetic field lines, hydrogen ions can drag ionized Xe out from the atmosphere to space even though neutral Xe cannot escape. [27] The mechanism is summarized as below. Xe can be directly photo-ionized by UV radiation in range of 91.2 n m < λ < 102.3 n m {\\displaystyle 91.2\\ {\\rm {{nm}<\\lambda <102.3nm}}} [28] X e + h v → X e + + e − {\\displaystyle {\\rm {Xe+hv\\rightarrow Xe^{+}+e^{-}}}} Or Xe can be ionized by change exchange with H 2 and CO 2 through C O 2 + + X e → C O 2 + X e + {\\displaystyle {\\rm {CO_{2}^{+}+Xe\\rightarrow CO_{2}+Xe^{+}}}} H 2 + + X e → H X e + + H {\\displaystyle {\\rm {H_{2}^{+}+Xe\\rightarrow HXe^{+}+H}}} where H + and CO 2 + can come from EUV dissociation. Xe + is chemically inert in H, H 2 , or CO 2 atmospheres. [30] As a result, Xe + tends to persist. These ions interact strongly with each other through the Coulomb force and are finally dragged away by strong ancient polar wind . Isotope mass fractionation accumulates as lighter isotopes of Xe + preferentially escape from the Earth. A preliminary model suggests that Xe can escape in the Archean if the atmosphere contains >1% H 2 or >0.5% methane. [28] When O 2 levels increased in the atmosphere, Xe + could exchange positive charge with O 2 though [30] X e + + O 2 → X e + O 2 + {\\displaystyle {\\rm {Xe^{+}+O_{2}\\rightarrow Xe+O_{2}^{+}}}} From this reaction, Xe escape stopped when the atmosphere became enriched in O 2 . As a result, Xe isotope fractionation may provide insights into the long history of hydrogen escape that ended with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) . [28] Understanding Xe isotopes is promising to reconstruct hydrogen or methane escape history that irreversibly oxidized the Earth and drove biological evolution toward aerobic ecological systems. [21] [31] [32] Other factors, such as the hydrogen (or methane) concentration becoming too low or EUV radiation from the aging Sun becoming too weak, can also cease the hydrodynamic escape of Xe, [28] but are not mutually exclusive. Organic hazes on Archean Earth could also scavenge isotopically heavy Xe. [25] Ionized Xe can be chemically incorporated into organic materials, [33] going through the terrestrial weathering cycle on the surface. The trapped Xe is mass fractionated by about 1% per amu in heavier isotopes [28] but they may be released again and recover the original unfractionated composition, making them not sufficient to totally resolve Xe paradox.",

        "text": "Xe isotopes are also promising in tracing mantle dynamics in Earth's evolution. The first explicit recognition of non-atmospheric Xe in terrestrial samples came from the analysis of CO 2 -well gas in New Mexico, displaying an excess of 129 I-derived or primitive source 129 Xe and high content in 131-136 Xe due to the decay of 238 U. [38] At present, the excess of 129 Xe and 131-136 Xe has been widely observed in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORBs) [39] [40] [41] and Oceanic island basalt (OIBs). [42] Because 136 Xe receives more fissiogenic contribution than other heavy Xe isotopes, 129 Xe (decay of 129 I) and 136 Xe are usually normalized to 130 Xe when discussing Xe isotope trends of different mantle sources. [11] MORBs' 129 Xe/ 130 Xe and 136 Xe/ 130 Xe ratios lie on a trend from atmospheric ratios to higher values [39] and seemingly contaminated by the air. Oceanic island basalt (OIBs) data lies lower than those in MORBs, implying different Xe sources for OIBs and MORBs. [42] The deviations in 129 Xe/ 130 Xe ratio between air and MORBs show that mantle degassing occurred before 129 I was extinct, otherwise 129 Xe/ 130 Xe in the air would be the same as in the mantle. [45] [46] The differences in the 129 Xe/ 130 Xe ratio between MORBs and OIBs may indicate that the mantle reservoirs are still not thoroughly mixed. The chemical differences between OIBs and MORBs still await discovery. [11] To obtain mantle Xe isotope ratios, it is necessary to remove contamination by atmospheric Xe, which could start before 2.5 billion years ago. [47] [48] Theoretically, the many non-radiogenic isotopic ratios ( 124 Xe/ 130 Xe, 126 Xe/ 130 Xe, and 128 Xe/ 130 Xe) can be used to accurately correct for atmospheric contamination if slight differences between air and mantle can be precisely measured. Still, we cannot reach such precision with current techniques. [11]",

        "section": "Giant planets",
        "text": "The planets of the Solar System are divided into two groups: the four inner planets are the terrestrial planets ( Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars ), with relatively small sizes and rocky surfaces. The four outer planets are the giant planets , which are dominated by hydrogen and helium and have lower mean densities. These can be further subdivided into the gas giants ( Jupiter and Saturn ) and the ice giants ( Uranus and Neptune ) that have large icy cores. [26] : 26–27, 283–284 Most of our direct information on the composition of the giant planets is from spectroscopy . Since the 1930s, Jupiter was known to contain hydrogen, methane and ammonium . In the 1960s, interferometry greatly increased the resolution and sensitivity of spectral analysis, allowing the identification of a much greater collection of molecules including ethane , acetylene , water and carbon monoxide . [27] : 138–139 However, Earth-based spectroscopy becomes increasingly difficult with more remote planets, since the reflected light of the Sun is much dimmer; and spectroscopic analysis of light from the planets can only be used to detect vibrations of molecules, which are in the infrared frequency range. This constrains the abundances of the elements H, C and N. [27] : 130 Two other elements are detected: phosphorus in the gas phosphine (PH 3 ) and germanium in germane (GeH 4 ). [27] : 131 The helium atom has vibrations in the ultraviolet range, which is strongly absorbed by the atmospheres of the outer planets and Earth. Thus, despite its abundance, helium was only detected once spacecraft were sent to the outer planets, and then only indirectly through collision-induced absorption in hydrogen molecules. [27] : 209 Further information on Jupiter was obtained from the Galileo probe when it was sent into the atmosphere in 1995; [28] [29] and the final mission of the Cassini probe in 2017 was to enter the atmosphere of Saturn. [30] In the atmosphere of Jupiter, He was found to be depleted by a factor of 2 compared to solar composition and Ne by a factor of 10, a surprising result since the other noble gases and the elements C, N and S were enhanced by factors of 2 to 4 (oxygen was also depleted but this was attributed to the unusually dry region that Galileo sampled). [29] Spectroscopic methods only penetrate the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn to depths where the pressure is about equal to 1 bar , approximately Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level . [27] : 131 The Galileo probe penetrated to 22 bars. [29] This is a small fraction of the planet, which is expected to reach pressures of over 40 Mbar. To constrain the composition in the interior, thermodynamic models are constructed using the information on temperature from infrared emission spectra and equations of state for the likely compositions. [27] : 131 High-pressure experiments predict that hydrogen will be a metallic liquid in the interior of Jupiter and Saturn, while in Uranus and Neptune it remains in the molecular state. [27] : 135–136 Estimates also depend on models for the formation of the planets. Condensation of the presolar nebula would result in a gaseous planet with the same composition as the Sun, but the planets could also have formed when a solid core captured nebular gas. [27] : 136 In current models, the four giant planets have cores of rock and ice that are roughly the same size, but the proportion of hydrogen and helium decreases from about 300 Earth masses in Jupiter to 75 in Saturn and just a few in Uranus and Neptune. [27] : 220 Thus, while the gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, the ice giants are primarily composed of heavier elements (O, C, N, S), primarily in the form of water, methane, and ammonia. The surfaces are cold enough for molecular hydrogen to be liquid, so much of each planet is likely a hydrogen ocean overlaying one of heavier compounds. [31] Outside the core, Jupiter has a mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen and an atmosphere of molecular hydrogen and helium. Metallic hydrogen does not mix well with helium, and in Saturn, it may form a separate layer below the metallic hydrogen. [27] : 138",

        "section": "Kinetic and equilibrium isotope effects",
        "text": "Isotopes differ by number of neutrons , which directly impacts physical properties based on mass and size. Normal hydrogen is hydrogen-1 or protium and has no neutrons. Deuterium or hydrogen-2 has one neutron and tritium or hydrogen-3 has two neutrons. These additional neutrons impact the mass of the atom, leading to different chemical physical properties . This effect is especially prevalent in hydrogen isotopes, since addition of a neutron doubles the mass from 1 H to 2 H. For heavier elements like carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , or sulfur , the mass difference is diluted. Physical chemists often model chemical bonding with the quantum harmonic oscillator , simplifying a hydrogen-hydrogen bond as two balls connected by a spring. [41] [44] The quantum harmonic oscillator is itself based on Hooke's law and acts as a good approximation of the Morse potential that accurately describes bonding. Modeling hydrogen/deuterium in a chemical reaction demonstrates the energy distributions of isotopes in products and reactants. Lower energy levels for the heavier isotope deuterium can be explained mathematically by the harmonic oscillator's dependence on the inverse of the reduced mass (μ). Thus, a larger reduced mass is a larger denominator and thus a smaller zero point energy and a lower energy state in the quantum well . Calculating the reduced mass of a 1 H- 1 H bond versus a deuterium-deuterium bond gives: The quantum harmonic oscillator has energy levels of the following form, where k is the spring constant and h is Planck's constant. [41] The effects of this energy distribution manifest in the kinetic isotope effect and the equilibrium isotope effect. [45] In a reversible reaction , under equilibrium conditions, the reaction will proceed forwards and backwards, distributing the isotopes to minimize thermodynamic free energy. Some time later, at equilibrium, more heavy isotopes will be on the product side. The stability of the lower energy drives the products to be enriched in deuterium relative to reactants. Conversely, under kinetic conditions, reactions are generally irreversible. The limiting step in the reaction is overcoming the activation energy barrier to reach an intermediate state. The lighter isotope has a higher energy state in the quantum well and will thus be preferentially formed into products. Thus under kinetic conditions the product will be relatively depleted in deuterium. Kinetic isotope effects are common in biological systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry. Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are stronger for larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy explains a large signal in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of bond breaking, diffusion or effusion , and condensation or evaporation reactions.",

        "text": "For some time, researchers believed that large hydrocarbon molecules were impervious to hydrogen exchange, but recent work has identified many reactions that allow isotope reordering. The isotopic exchange becomes relevant at geological time scales and has impacted work of biologists studying lipid biomarkers as well as geologists studying ancient oil . Reactions responsible for exchange include [46] [47] Detailed kinetics of these reactions have not been determined. However, it is known that clay minerals catalyze ionic hydrogen exchange faster than other minerals. [48] Thus hydrocarbons formed in clastic environments exchange more than those in carbonate settings. Aromatic and tertiary hydrogen also have greater exchange rates than primary hydrogen. This is due to the increasing stability of associated carbocations . [49] Primary carbocations are considered too unstable to physically exist and have never been isolated in an FT-ICR spectrometer . [50] On the other hand, tertiary carbocations are relatively stable and are often intermediates in organic chemistry reactions. This stability, which increases the likelihood of proton loss, is due to the electron donation of nearby carbon atoms. Resonance and nearby lone pairs can also stabilize carbocations via electron donation . Aromatic carbons are thus relatively easy to exchange. Many of these reactions have a strong temperature dependence, with higher temperatures typically accelerating exchange. However, different mechanisms may prevail at each temperature window. Ionic exchange , for example, has the most significance at low temperatures. In such low temperature environments, there is potential for preserving the original hydrogen isotope signal over hundreds of millions of years. [51] However, many rocks in geologic time have reached significant thermal maturity . Even by the onset of the oil window it appears that much of the hydrogen has exchanged. Recently, scientists have explored a silver lining: hydrogen exchange is a zero order kinetic reaction (for carbon bound hydrogen at 80–100 °C, the half-times are likely 10 4 – 10 5 years). [51] Applying the mathematics of rate constants would allow extrapolation to original isotopic compositions. While this solution holds promise, there is too much disagreement in the literature for robust calibrations.",

The values of δD generally fall in the range of around −30 ~ -150‰ in the northern hemisphere and −30~+30‰ over the land areas of the southern hemisphere. In North America, the δD values of average monthly precipitation across regions are more negative in January (ranging up to around −300‰ in Canada) compared to July (up to around −190‰). [65] The overall mean precipitation is determined by balance between the evaporation of water from the oceans and surface water sources and the condensation of the atmospheric water vapor in the form of rain. The net evaporation should equal the net precipitation, and the δD value for the mean isotopic composition of global precipitation is around −22‰ (global average). [66] The Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) investigates and monitors the isotopic composition of precipitation at various sites all over the world. The mean precipitation can be estimated by the equation, δ 2 H = 8.17(±0.07) δ 18 O + 11.27(±0.65)‰ VSMOW. (Rozanski et al., 1993) This equation is the slightly modified version from the general 'Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL)' equation, δ 2 H = 8.13δ 18 O + 10.8, which provides the average relationship between δ 2 H and δ 18 O of natural terrestrial waters.

This is due to several reasons with regard to hydrogen: The classical offline preparation for the conversion is combustion over CuO at > 800 °C in sealed quartz tubes, followed by the isolation of resulting water and the reduction to H 2 over hot metal at 400 ~1000 °C on a vacuum line. [105] The produced gas is then directly injected into the dual-inlet mass spectrometer for measurement. [104] The metals used for the reduction to H 2 includes U, Zn, Cr, Mg and Mn, etc. U and Zn had been widely used since the 1950s [25] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] until Cr [111] was successfully employed in the late 1990s. The offline combustion/reduction has the highest accuracy and precision for hydrogen isotope measurement without limits for sample types. The analytical uncertainty is typically 1~2‰ in δD . Thus it is still being used today when highest levels of precision are required. However, the offline preparation procedure is very time-consuming and complicated. It also requires large sample size (several 100 mg). Thus the online preparation based on combustion/reduction coupled with the subsequent continuous flow-IRMS (CF-IRMS) system has been more commonly used nowadays. Chromium reduction or high temperature conversion are the dominant online preparation methods for the detection of hydrogen isotope by IRMS.",

        "text": "TC/EA (or HTC, high temperature conversion; HTP, high temperature pyrolysis ; HTCR, high temperature carbon reduction) is an 'online' or 'continuous flow' preparation method typically followed by IRMS detection. This is a \"bulk\" technique that measures all of the hydrogen in a given sample and provides the average isotope signal. The weighed sample is placed in a tin or silver capsule and dropped into a pyrolysis tube of TC/EA. The tube is made of glassy carbon with glassy carbon filling in which way oxygen isotope can be measured simultaneously without the oxygen exchange with ceramic (Al 2 O 3 ) surface. [113] The molecules are then reduced into CO and H 2 at high temperature (> 1400°C) in the reactor. The gaseous products are separated through gas chromatography (GC) using helium as the carrier gas, followed by a split-flow interface, and finally detected by IRMS. TC/EA method can be problematic for organic compounds with halogen or nitrogen due to the competition between the pyrolysis byproducts (e.g. HCl and HCN) and H 2 formation. [114] [115] In addition, it is susceptible to contamination with water, so samples must be scrupulously dried. An adaption of this method is to determine the non-exchangeable (C-H) and exchangeable hydrogen (bounds to other elements, e.g. O, S and N) in organic matter. The samples are equilibrated with water in sealed autosampler carousels at 115 °C and then transferred into pyrolysis EA followed by IRMS measurement. [116] TC/EA method is quick with a relatively high precision (~ 1‰). It was limited to solid samples, however, liquid sample recently can also be measured in TC/EA-IRMS system by adapting an autosampler for liquids. The drawback of TC/EA is the relatively big sample size (~ mg), which is smaller than offline combustion/reduction but larger than GC/pyrolysis. It cannot separate different compounds as GC/pyrolysis does and thus only the average for the whole sample can be provided, which is also a drawback for some research.",

This is a 'compound-specific' method, allowing separation of analytes prior to measurement and thus providing information about the isotopic composition of each individual compound. Following GC separation, samples are converted to smaller gaseous molecules for isotope measurements. GC/pyrolysis uses the pyrolysis interface between GC and IRMS for the conversion of H and O in the molecules into H 2 and CO. GC-IRMS was first introduced by Matthews and Hayes in the late 1970s, [117] and was later used for δ 13 C, δ 15 N, δ 18 O and δ 34 S. Helium is used as the carrier gas in the GC systems. However, the separation of DH (m/z=3) signal from the tail of 4 He + beam was problematic due to the intense signal of 4 He + . [118] During the early 1990s, intense efforts were made in solving the difficulties to measure δD by GC/pyrolysis-IRMS. In 1999, Hilkert et al. developed a robust method by integrating the high temperature conversion (TC) into GC-IRMS and adding a pre-cup electrostatic sector and a retardation lens in front of the m/z=3 cup collector. Several different groups were working on this at the same time. [118] [119] [120] [121] This GC/pyrolysis-IRMS based on TC has been widely used for δD measurement nowadays. The commercial products of GC-IRMS include both combustion and pyrolysis interfaces so that δ 13 C and δD can be measured simultaneously. The significant advantage of GC/pyrolysis method for hydrogen isotope measurement is that it can separate different compounds in the samples. It requires the smallest sample size (a typical size of ~200 ng [119] ) relative to other methods and also has a high precision of 1~5 ‰. But this method is relatively slow and limited to the samples which can be applied in GC system.",

        "text": "Water is the primary source of hydrogen to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The water cycle (hydrological cycle) moves water around different reservoirs on the surface of the earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly fractionated. [142] As the main moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). [143] Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. [142] In the water cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation. It should be pointed out that oxygen isotopic composition ( 18 O/ 16 O) of water is also an important tracer in the water cycle, and cannot be separated from hydrogen isotopes when we talk about isotope fractionation processes associated with water. During evaporation of water from the ocean to the atmosphere, both equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects occur to determine the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of the resulting water vapor. At the water-air interface, a stagnant boundary layer is saturated with water vapor (100% relative humidity ), and the isotopic composition of water vapor in the boundary layer reflects an equilibrium fractionation with liquid water. The liquid-vapor equilibrium fractionations for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are temperature-dependent: [144] 2 ε l − v = 52.612 − 76.248 × 1000 T ( K ) + 24.844 × 10 6 T ( K ) 2 {\\displaystyle ^{2}\\varepsilon _{l-v}=52.612-76.248\\times {1000 \\over T(K)}+24.844\\times {10^{6} \\over T(K)^{2}}} (‰) 18 ε l − v = − 2.0667 − 0.4156 × 1000 T ( K ) + 1.137 × 10 6 T ( K ) 2 {\\displaystyle ^{18}\\varepsilon _{l-v}=-2.0667-0.4156\\times {1000 \\over T(K)}+1.137\\times {10^{6} \\over T(K)^{2}}} (‰) The magnitude of the liquid-vapor equilibrium fractionation for hydrogen isotopes is about 8 times that of oxygen isotopes at Earth surface temperatures, which reflects the relative mass differences of the two isotope systems ( 2 H is 100% heavier than 1 H, 18 O is 12.5% heavier than 16 O). Above the boundary layer, there is a transition zone with relative humidity less than 100%, and there is a kinetic isotope fractionation associated with water vapor diffusion from the boundary layer to the transition zone, which is empirically related to the relative humidity (h): [145] 2 ε b l − v = 12.5 ( 1 − h ) {\\displaystyle ^{2}\\varepsilon _{bl-v}=12.5(1-h)} ‰ 18 ε b l − v = 14.2 ( 1 − h ) {\\displaystyle ^{18}\\varepsilon _{bl-v}=14.2(1-h)} ‰ The kinetic isotope effect associated with diffusion reflects the mass difference of the heavy-isotope substituted water molecules (H 2 H 16 O and H 2 18 O) relative to the normal isotopolog (H 2 16 O). After water evaporates to the atmosphere, it is transported and returned to the surface through condensation and precipitation. Condensation of water vapor occurs in ascending air masses that develop a lower temperature and saturation vapor pressure. Since the cooling and condensation happens at relatively slow rates, it is a process with equilibrium isotope effects. However, as water vapor is progressively condensed and lost from the air during moisture transport, the isotopic composition of the remaining vapor, as well as the resulting precipitation, can be largely depleted due to the process of Rayleigh distillation . The equation for Rayleigh distillation is: [146] R r / R 0 = f α − 1 {\\displaystyle R_{r}/R_{0}=f^{\\alpha -1}} In the equation, R 0 represents the isotope ratio in the initial water vapor, R r represents the isotope ratio in the remaining water vapor after some condensation, f is the fraction of water vapor remaining in the air, and α is the liquid-vapor equilibrium fractionation factor (α=1+ε). The isotopic composition of the resulting precipitation (R p ) can be derived from the composition of the remaining vapor: R p / R r = ( 1 + δ p ) / ( 1 + δ r ) = α = 1 + ε {\\displaystyle R_{p}/R_{r}=(1+\\delta _{p})/(1+\\delta _{r})=\\alpha =1+\\varepsilon } As f decreases progressively during condensation, the remaining vapor becomes more and more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh distillation process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, [1] all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model can also be used to explain the strong correlation between δD and δ 18 O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): δD = 8δ 18 O+10 [147] (later updated to δD = 8.17±0.07 δ 18 O+11.27±0.65 [41] ) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. The intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. [145] Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.",

        "text": "The isotopic composition of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers have been developed as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein was one of the first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. [160] Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow isotopic composition of the past few glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. [161] Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed trace gas (e.g. CH 4 ) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. [162] Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 10 5 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ 18 O in the last ice age. [163] [164] The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, [165] and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. [166] One of the best δD -based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. [159] The δD -temperature (of the inversion layer where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔT I =(ΔδD ice -8Δδ 18 O sw )/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. [159] Many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. [167] Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8 °C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH 4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) Antarctic air temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. [159] Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. [166] [168] [169] [170] There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. [171] A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar isotope shift and cooling during the last ice age. [172] Other existing alpine glacial isotope records include Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Altai and West Belukha Plateau in Russia, Mount Logan in Canada, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, USA, and the Illimani Ice Core in Bolivia, most of which cover an interval of the Holocene epoch.

        "text": "Terrestrial plants make leaf waxes to coat the surfaces of their leaves as an adaptation to minimize water loss. These waxes are largely straight-chain n -alkyl lipids. They are insoluble, non-volatile, chemically inert, and resistant to degradation, making them easily preserved in the sedimentary record, and therefore good targets as biomarkers . [181] The main water source for terrestrial plants is soil water, which largely resembles the hydrogen isotope composition of rain water, but varies between environments and with enrichment by precipitation , depletion by evaporation , and exchange with atmospheric water vapor. There can be a significant offset between the δD value of source water and the δD value of leaf water at the site of lipid biosynthesis. No fractionation is associated with water uptake by roots, a process usually driven by capillary tension, with the one exception of xerophytes that burn ATP to pump water in extremely arid environments (with a roughly 10‰ depletion). [182] However, leaf water can be substantially enriched relative to soil water due to transpiration , an evaporative process which is influenced by temperature, humidity, and the composition of surrounding water vapor. The leaf water hydrogen isotope composition can be described with a modified Craig-Gordon model, [183] where ΔD e is the steady state enrichment of leaf water, ε eq is the temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between liquid water and vapor, ε k is the kinetic isotope effect from diffusion between leaf internal air space and the atmosphere, ΔD v is the leaf/air disequilibrium, e a is atmospheric vapor pressure, and e i is internal leaf vapor pressure. The Péclet effect, which describes the opposing forces of advection and diffusion can be added to the model as where E is the transpiration rate, L is the length scale of transport, C is the concentration of water, and D is the diffusion coefficient. While the role of rain water δD as the fundamental control on the final δD of lipids is well documented, [184] the importance of fractionation effects from rain water to soil water and leaf water on ε l/w is appreciated but remains poorly understood. [173] [185] Organic biomolecules are generally depleted relative to the δD of leaf water. [173] However, differences between organisms, biosynthetic pathways, and biological roles of different molecules can lead to huge variability in fractionation; the diversity of lipid biomarkers spans a 600‰ range of δD values. [186] Lipid biosynthesis is biochemically complex, involving multiple enzyme-dependent steps that can lead to isotope fractionations. There are three major pathways of lipid biosynthesis, known as the mevalonate pathway , the acetogenic pathway , and the 1-deoxyD-xylulose-5-phosphate/2-methylerythroyl-4-phosphate pathway . [187] The acetogenic pathway is responsible for the production of n -alkyl lipids like leaf waxes, and is associated with a smaller δD depletion relative to source water than the other two lipid biosynthesis pathways. [32] [188] While leaf water is the main source of hydrogen in leaf biomolecules, relatively depleted hydrogen from acetate or NADPH is often added during biosynthesis, and contributes to the hydrogen composition of the final molecule. Secondary hydrogen exchange reactions, meaning hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions outside of the primary biosynthetic pathway, also contribute substantially to the variability of lipid hydrogen isotope composition [189] It is important to note that biological differences in fractionation stem not only from biochemical differences between different molecules, but also from physiological differences between different organisms. For example, the δD values of multiple leaf wax molecules are enriched in shrubs (median ~ -90‰) relative to trees (median ~ -135‰), which themselves are enriched relative to both C 3 (median ~ -160‰) and C 4 grasses (median ~ -140‰). [173] Between individual species, substantial variation of δD values have been documented. [190] [191] [192] [193] Other physiological factors that contribute to variable leaf wax δD values include the seasonal timing of leaf development, [194] response to external stress or environmental variability, [195] and the presence or absence of stomata [184] It can be difficult to distinguish between physiological factors and environmental factors, when many physiological adaptations are directly related to environment. Several environmental factors have been shown to contribute to leaf wax δD variability, in addition to environmental effects on the δD of source water. Humidity is known to impact lipid δD values at moderate humidity levels, but not at particularly high (>80%) or low (<40%) humidity levels, and a broad trend of enriched δD values, meaning smaller ε l/w , is seen in arid regions. [173] [175] [190] Temperature and sunlight intensity, both correlated to geographic latitude, have strong effects on the rates of metabolism and transpiration, and by extension on ε l/w . [196] Additionally, the average chain length of leaf wax molecules varies with geographic latitude, and ε l/w has been shown to increase with increasing chain length [184] When using biomarkers as a proxy for reconstructing ancient environments, it is important to be aware of the biases inherent in the sedimentary record. Leaf matter incorporated into sediment is largely deposited during the autumn, so seasonal variations in leaf waxes must be considered accordingly. [184] Furthermore, sediments average leaf waxes over lots of different plants in both space and time, making it difficult to calibrate the biological constraints on ε l/w . [173] Finally, preservation of biomolecules in the geologic record does not faithfully represent whole ecosystems, and there is always the threat of hydrogen exchange, particularly if the sediments are subjected to high temperatures. The hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes can be summarized as the δD of rain water, with three main fractionation steps- evaporation from soil water, transpiration from leaf water, and lipid biosynthesis, which can be combined and measured as the net fractionation, or ε l/w . [173] With the application of ever-improving measurement techniques for single molecules, and correlation with other independent proxies in the geological record that can help constrain some variables, investigating the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes can be extremely productive. Leaf wax δD data has been successfully applied to improving our understanding of climate driven changes in terrestrial hydrology, by demonstrating that ocean circulation and surface temperature have a significant effect on continental precipitation. [197] [198] Leaf wax δD values have also been used as records of paleoaltimetry to reconstruct the elevation gradients in ancient mountain ranges based on the effect of altitude on rain water δD .

Coccolithophores are marine haptophyte algae, and include the globally iconic species Emiliania huxleyi , one of the main CaCO 3 producers in the ocean. The δD values of alkenones are highly correlated to the δD values of sea water, and therefore can be used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental properties that constrain the isotopic composition of sea water. The most notable reconstruction that alkenone δD values are applied to is the salinity of ancient oceans. Both the δD values of sea water and the fractionations associated with hyptophyte biochemistry (ε bio ) are fairly well understood, so alkenones can be readily used to observe the secondary effect of salinity on δD . [201] There is a well established positive linear correlation between salinity and ε l/w , on the order of a ~3‰ change in fractionation per salinity unit. [202] Hypothesized mechanisms for this effect include enrichment of D in intracellular water due to reduced exchange with extracellular water at higher salinity, [203] removal of H from intracellular water due to increased production of solutes to maintain osmotic pressure at higher salinity, [204] and lower haptophyte growth rates at higher salinity [173] Alkenone δD values have been used successfully to reconstruct past salinity changes in the Mediterranean Sea., [205] Black Sea, [206] [207] Panama Basin, [208] and Mozambique Channel. [201] As an extension of salinity, this data was also used to draw further conclusions about ancient environments, such as ancient freshwater flooding events, [205] [206] and the evolution of plankton in response to environmental changes [207]",

        "section": "Natural gas",
        "text": "Commonly, hydrogen isotope composition of natural gas from the same well has a trend of δD methane < δD ethane < δD propane < δD C4+ . This is because most natural gas is thought to generated by step-wise thermal cracking that is mostly irreversible and thus governed by normal kinetic isotope effects that favor light isotopes. The same trend, known as \"the normal order\", [229] holds for carbon isotopes of natural gas. For example, Angola gas is reported to have a methane δD range of −190‰ to −140‰, an ethane δD of −146‰ to −107‰, a propane δD of −116‰ to −90‰, and a butane δD of −118‰ to −85‰. [230] However, some recent studies show that opposite patterns could also exist, meaning δD methane > δD ethane > δD propane . This phenomenon is often called 'isotopic reversal' or 'isotopic rollover'. The isotopic order could also be partly reversed, like δD methane > δD ethane < δD propane or δD methane < δD ethane > δD propane . [229] Burruss et al. found that in the deepest samples of northern Appalachian basin the hydrogen isotopic order for methane and ethane is reversed. [231] Liu et al., also found partial reversal in oil-related gas from the Tarim Basin. [229] The mechanism causing this reversal is still unknown. Possible explanations include mixing between gases of different maturities and sources, oxidation of methane, etc. Jon Telling et al., synthesized isotopically reversed (in both C and H) low-molecular alkanes using gas-phase radical recombination reactions in electrical discharge experiments, providing another possible mechanism. [232] Methane is a major component of natural gas. Geosphere methane is intriguing for the large input of microbial methanogenesis . This process exhibits a strong isotope effect , resulting in greater D-depletion in methane relative to other hydrocarbons . δD ranges from −275‰ to −100‰ in thermogenic methane, and from −400‰ to −150‰ in microbial methane. [95] Also, methane formed by marine methanogens is generally enriched in D relative to methane from freshwater methanogens . δD of methane has been plotted together with other geochemical tools(like δ 13 C, gas wetness) to categorize and identify natural gas. A δD-δ 13 C diagram (sometimes called CD diagram, Whiticar diagram, or Schoell diagram) is widely used to place methane in one of the three distinct groups: thermogenic methane that is higher in both δ 13 C and δD ; marine microbial methane that is more depleted in 13 C and freshwater microbial methane that is more depleted in D. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis produces less D-depleted methane relative to acetoclastic methanogenesis. The location where the organism lives and substrate concentration also affect isotopic composition: rumen methanogenesis, which occurs in a more closed system and with higher partial pressures of hydrogen, exhibits a greater fractionation (−300 to −400‰) than wetland methanogenesis (−250 to −170‰). [233] [234] Recent advances in analytical chemistry have enabled high-precision measurements of multiply substituted (or 'clumped') isotopologues like 13 CH 3 D. This is a novel tool for studying methane formation. This proxy is based on the abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane, which should be enriched compared to the stochastic distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium because the reduced zero-point energy for heavy-heavy isotope bonding is more than twice the reduced zero-point energy of heavy-light isotope bonding. [235] The extent of enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, as higher entropy tends to randomize isotope distribution.  Stolper et al. established this temperature calibration using laboratory equilibrated methane and field methane from known formation temperature, and applied this to several gas reservoirs to study natural gas formation and mixing. [236] Wang et al. also reported strong non-equilibrium isotope effect in methane clumped isotopes from lab-cultured methanogens and field samples. [237] These methane samples have relatively low abundance of clumped isotopologues, sometimes even lower than the stochastic distribution. This indicates that there are irreversible steps in enzymatic reactions during methanogenesis [237] that fractionation against clumped isotopologues to create the depleted signal. Isotope clumping in methane has proven a robust proxy, and scientists are now moving towards higher-order alkane molecules like ethane for further work. [238]",

The ratio of 18 O to 16 O in the shell is used to indirectly determine the temperature of the surrounding water at the time the shell was formed. The ratio varies slightly depending on the temperature of the surrounding water, as well as other factors such as the water's salinity, and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets. δ 18 O also reflects local evaporation and freshwater input, as rainwater is 16 O-enriched—a result of the preferential evaporation of the lighter 16 O from seawater. Consequently, the surface ocean contains greater proportions of 18 O around the subtropics and tropics where there is more evaporation, and lesser proportions of 18 O in the mid-latitudes where it rains more. Similarly, when water vapor condenses, heavier water molecules holding 18 O atoms tend to condense and precipitate first. The water vapor gradient heading from the tropics to the poles gradually becomes more and more depleted of 18 O. Snow falling in Canada has much less H 2 18 O than rain in Florida ; similarly, snow falling in the center of ice sheets has a lighter δ 18 O signature than that at its margins, since heavier 18 O precipitates first. Changes in climate that alter global patterns of evaporation and precipitation therefore change the background δ 18 O ratio. Solid samples (organic and inorganic) for oxygen isotope analysis are usually stored in silver cups and measured with pyrolysis and mass spectrometry .

[62] The biological pathway by which an organism takes up and/or removes sulfur can have significant impacts on the sulfur isotope composition of the organism and its environment. Microorganisms that consume and reduce sulfate in relatively large quantities perform a different pathway of sulfur uptake called dissimilatory sulfate reduction . These organisms use sulfate reduction as an energy source as opposed to a way to synthesize new cell components, and remove the resulting sulfide as a waste product. Microbial sulfate reduction has been demonstrated to fractionate sulfur isotopes in bacteria, with some studies showing a dependence upon sulfate concentration [28] and/or temperature. [64] Studies examining dozens of species of dissimilatory sulfate reducing microbes have observed sulfur isotope fractionations ranging from −65.6‰ to 0‰. [28] [30] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Some organisms take in relatively small amounts of sulfate in a process called assimilatory sulfate reduction , for the purpose of synthesizing compounds that contain sulfur, such as the amino acids methionine and cysteine that can then be used to make proteins . [65] In phytoplankton, most of the sulfur taken up through assimilatory sulfate reduction is incorporated into biomass as proteins (~35%), sulfate esters (~20%), and low-weight sulfur-containing compounds (~40%). [66] [67] Literature on the isotopic fractionation effects of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway is much more limited than that discussing dissimilatory sulfate reduction, but some sources report slight isotopic variations ( δ 34 S = −4.4‰ to +0.5‰) in the resulting organic sulfur relative to the surrounding sulfate. [68] While dissimilatory sulfate reduction and assimilatory sulfate reduction are two of the most common pathways by which organisms take up and utilize sulfate, there are many other pathways by which living things take up sulfur. For example, sulfur oxidation of compounds like hydrogen sulfide and elemental sulfur is performed by lithotrophic bacteria and chemosynthetic archaea . [69] [70] Most animals obtain sulfur directly from the methionine and cysteine in the protein they consume. [71]",

        "text": "Previous efforts to understand how sulfur metabolism and biosynthetic pathways relied on expensive labeling experiments using radioactive 35 S. By leveraging natural assimilatory processes, stable isotope ratios can be used to track the sources of sulfur for plants, plant organs used in sulfur acquisition, the movement of sulfur through plants. Sulfur (S) stable isotope composition measurements are often performed using an Elemental Analysis-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, ( EA-IRMS ) [72] in which organic sulfur from biological samples is oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and analyzed on a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer is used to quantify the ratio of the lighter ( 32 S 16 O 2 ) to the heavier ( 34 S 16 O 2 ) isotopologue of SO 2 , and this ratio is then compared to sulfur isotope standards in order to standardize data to the VSMOW scale. In biological materials, sulfur is scarce relative to other organic elements like carbon and oxygen, introducing some additional difficulty in measuring its stable isotope composition. The elemental S composition of plant matter is ≈0.2%, accounting for approximately 2 mmol/m 2 in most leaf tissue. [73] In order to reach detectable levels of 30 ng to 3 μg of elemental S to calculate reliable δ 34 S values, leaf tissue samples need to be between 2–5 mg. Improvements in detection have been made in recent years in the utilization of gas chromatography coupled with multicollector ICP-MS (GC/MC-ICP-MS) [74] to be able to measure pmol quantities of organic S. Additionally, ICP-MS has been used to measure nanomolar quantities of dissolved sulfate. [75] Most studies have focused on measuring the bulk δ 34 S value of plant tissues and few studies have been performed on measuring the δ 34 S values of individual S-containing compounds. The coupling of high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ICP-MS has been proposed as a way to test individual S-containing compounds. [73]",

        "text": "If soil sulfur is derived consistently from one source, the water-soluble and insoluble organic S fractions acquire similar isotopic compositions. In the case that there are two or more sources and/or if the isotopic composition of atmospheric or groundwater sulfate fluctuates, there may not be sufficient time for isotopic homogenization among the various forms of sulfur. The primary form of sulfur in soil is sulfate, which is transported upwards through the root system with minimal δ 34 S fractionation by 1–2‰. [81] In contrast to higher canopy plants reflecting atmospheric δ 34 S, protected understory plants tend to reflect soil sulfur. [77]",

        "text": "A number of microbial metabolisms fractionate sulfur isotopes in distinctive ways, and the sulfur isotopic fingerprints of these metabolisms can be preserved in minerals and ancient organic matter. [1] By measuring the sulfur isotopic composition of these preserved materials, scientists can reconstruct ancient biological processes and the environments where they occurred. [1] δ 34 S values in the geologic record have been inferred to reveal the history of microbial sulfate reduction [87] [88] and sulfide oxidation. [25] [89] Paired δ 34 S and Δ 33 S records have also been used to show ancient microbial sulfur disproportionation. [90] [29] Microbial dissimilatory sulfate reduction (MSR), an energy-yielding metabolism performed by bacteria in anoxic environments, is associated with an especially large fractionation factor. [1] The observed 34 ε MSR values range from 0 to −65.6‰. [28] [30] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Many factors influence the size of this fractionation, including sulfate reduction rate, [35] [40] sulfate concentration and transport, [28] [44] availability of electron donors and other nutrients, [30] [42] [43] and physiological differences like protein expression. [45] Sulfide produced through MSR may then go on to form the mineral pyrite, preserving the 34 S-depleted fingerprint of MSR in sedimentary rocks. [1] [60] Many studies have investigated the δ 34 S values of ancient pyrite in order to understand past biological and environmental conditions. [1] For example, pyrite δ 34 S records have been used to reconstruct shifts in primary productivity levels, [91] changing ocean oxygen content, [92] [93] and glacial-interglacial changes in sea level and weathering. [94] Some studies compare sulfur isotopes in pyrite to a second sulfur-containing material, like dissolved sulfate or preserved organic matter. [25] [91] [92] Comparing pyrite to another material gives a fuller picture of how sulfur moved through ancient environments: it provides clues about the size of ancient 34 ε MSR values and the environmental conditions controlling MSR fractionation of sulfur isotopes.
