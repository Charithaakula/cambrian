        "text": "Metamorphism is the set of processes by which existing rock is transformed physically or chemically at elevated temperature, without actually melting to any great degree. The importance of heating in the formation of metamorphic rock was first recognized by the pioneering Scottish naturalist, James Hutton , who is often described as the father of modern geology. Hutton wrote in 1795 that some rock beds of the Scottish Highlands had originally been sedimentary rock , but had been transformed by great heat. [3] Hutton also speculated that pressure was important in metamorphism. This hypothesis was tested by his friend, James Hall , who sealed chalk into a makeshift pressure vessel constructed from a cannon barrel and heated it in an iron foundry furnace. Hall found that this produced a material strongly resembling marble , rather than the usual quicklime produced by heating of chalk in the open air. French geologists subsequently added metasomatism , the circulation of fluids through buried rock, to the list of processes that help bring about metamorphism. However, metamorphism can take place without metasomatism (isochemical metamorphism) or at depths of just a few hundred meters where pressures are relatively low (for example, in contact metamorphism). [3] Rock can be transformed without melting because heat causes atomic bonds to break, freeing the atoms to move and form new bonds with other atoms . Pore fluid present between mineral grains is an important medium through which atoms are exchanged. [4] This permits recrystallization of existing minerals or crystallization of new minerals with different crystalline structures or chemical compositions (neocrystallization). [1] The transformation converts the minerals in the protolith into forms that are more stable (closer to chemical equilibrium ) under the conditions of pressure and temperature at which metamorphism takes place. [5] [6] Metamorphism is generally regarded to begin at temperatures of 100 to 200 °C (212 to 392 °F). This excludes diagenetic changes due to compaction and lithification , which result in the formation of sedimentary rocks. [7] The upper boundary of metamorphic conditions lies at the solidus of the rock, which is the temperature at which the rock begins to melt. At this point, the process becomes an igneous process. [8] The solidus temperature depends on the composition of the rock, the pressure, and whether the rock is saturated with water. Typical solidus temperatures range from 650 °C (1,202 °F) for wet granite at a few hundred megapascals (MPa) of pressure [9] to about 1,080 °C (1,980 °F) for wet basalt at atmospheric pressure. [10] Migmatites are rocks formed at this upper limit, which contains pods and veins of material that has started to melt but has not fully segregated from the refractory residue. [11] The metamorphic process can occur at almost any pressure, from near surface pressure (for contact metamorphism) to pressures in excess of 16 kbar (1600 MPa). [12]",

        "section": "Recrystallization",
        "text": "The change in the grain size and orientation in the rock during the process of metamorphism is called recrystallization . For instance, the small calcite crystals in the sedimentary rocks limestone and chalk change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock marble . [13] In metamorphosed sandstone , recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite , also known as metaquartzite, in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked. [14] Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization. High temperatures allow the atoms and ions in solid crystals to migrate, thus reorganizing the crystals, while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their points of contact ( pressure solution ) and redeposition in pore space. [15] During recrystallization, the identity of the mineral does not change, only its texture. Recrystallization generally begins when temperatures reach above half the melting point of the mineral on the Kelvin scale. [16] Pressure solution begins during diagenesis (the process of lithification of sediments into sedimentary rock) but is completed during early stages of metamorphism. For a sandstone protolith, the dividing line between diagenesis and metamorphism can be placed at the point where strained quartz grains begin to be replaced by new, unstrained, small quartz grains, producing a mortar texture that can be identified in thin sections under a polarizing microscope. With increasing grade of metamorphism, further recrystallization produces foam texture , characterized by polygonal grains meeting at triple junctions, and then porphyroblastic texture , characterized by coarse, irregular grains, including some larger grains ( porphyroblasts .) [17] Metamorphic rocks are typically more coarsely crystalline than the protolith from which they formed. Atoms in the interior of a crystal are surrounded by a stable arrangement of neighboring atoms. This is partially missing at the surface of the crystal, producing a surface energy that makes the surface thermodynamically unstable. Recrystallization to coarser crystals reduces the surface area and so minimizes the surface energy. [18] Although grain coarsening is a common result of metamorphism, rock that is intensely deformed may eliminate strain energy by recrystallizing as a fine-grained rock called mylonite . Certain kinds of rock, such as those rich in quartz, carbonate minerals , or olivine, are particularly prone to form mylonites, while feldspar and garnet are resistant to mylonitization. [19]",

However, at atmospheric pressure, kyanite transforms to andalusite at a temperature of about 190 °C (374 °F). Andalusite, in turn, transforms to sillimanite when the temperature reaches about 800 °C (1,470 °F). At pressures above about 4 kbar (400 MPa), kyanite transforms directly to sillimanite as the temperature increases.

        "section": "Dynamothermal",
        "text": "To many geologists, regional metamorphism is practically synonymous with dynamothermal metamorphism. [30] This form of metamorphism takes place at convergent plate boundaries , where two continental plates or a continental plate and an island arc collide. The collision zone becomes a belt of mountain formation called an orogeny . The orogenic belt is characterized by thickening of the Earth's crust, during which the deeply buried crustal rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures and is intensely deformed. [33] [34] Subsequent erosion of the mountains exposes the roots of the orogenic belt as extensive outcrops of metamorphic rock, [35] characteristic of mountain chains. [33] Metamorphic rock formed in these settings tends to shown well-developed foliation . [33] Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during metamorphism. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite , to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage . Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale , and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates. [36] The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone , the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite , which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss , which is coarse to very coarse-grained. [37] Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture. Collisional orogenies are preceded by subduction of oceanic crust. [38] The conditions within the subducting slab as it plunges toward the mantle in a subduction zone produce their own distinctive regional metamorphic effects , characterized by paired metamorphic belts . [39] The pioneering work of George Barrow on regional metamorphism in the Scottish Highlands showed that some regional metamorphism produces well-defined, mappable zones of increasing metamorphic grade. This Barrovian metamorphism is the most recognized metamorphic series in the world. However, Barrovian metamorphism is specific to pelitic rock, formed from mudstone or siltstone , and it is not unique even in pelitic rock. A different sequence in the northeast of Scotland defines Buchan metamorphism , which took place at lower pressure than the Barrovian. [40]",

This shows none of the effects of deformation and folding so characteristic of dynamothermal metamorphism.

        "text": "Contact metamorphism occurs typically around intrusive igneous rocks as a result of the temperature increase caused by the intrusion of magma into cooler country rock . The area surrounding the intrusion where the contact metamorphism effects are present is called the metamorphic aureole , [44] the contact aureole , or simply the aureole. [45] Contact metamorphic rocks are usually known as hornfels . Rocks formed by contact metamorphism may not present signs of strong deformation and are often fine-grained [46] [47] and extremely tough. [48] The Yule Marble used on the Lincoln Memorial exterior and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery was formed by contact metamorphism. [49] Contact metamorphism is greater adjacent to the intrusion and dissipates with distance from the contact. [50] The size of the aureole depends on the heat of the intrusion, its size, and the temperature difference with the wall rocks. Dikes generally have small aureoles with minimal metamorphism, extending not more than one or two dike thicknesses into the surrounding rock, [51] whereas the aureoles around batholiths can be up to several kilometers wide. [52] [53] The metamorphic grade of an aureole is measured by the peak metamorphic mineral which forms in the aureole. This is usually related to the metamorphic temperatures of pelitic or aluminosilicate rocks and the minerals they form. The metamorphic grades of aureoles at shallow depth are albite - epidote hornfels, hornblende hornfels, pyroxene hornfels, and sillimanite hornfels, in increasing order of temperature of formation. However, the albite-epidote hornfels is often not formed, even though it is the lowest temperature grade. [54] Magmatic fluids coming from the intrusive rock may also take part in the metamorphic reactions . An extensive addition of magmatic fluids can significantly modify the chemistry of the affected rocks. In this case the metamorphism grades into metasomatism . If the intruded rock is rich in carbonate the result is a skarn . [55] Fluorine -rich magmatic waters which leave a cooling granite may often form greisens within and adjacent to the contact of the granite. [56] Metasomatic altered aureoles can localize the deposition of metallic ore minerals and thus are of economic interest. [57] [58] Fenitization , or Na-metasomatism , is a distinctive form of contact metamorphism accompanied by metasomatism. It takes place around intrusions of a rare type of magma called a carbonatite that is highly enriched in carbonates and low in silica . Cooling bodies of carbonatite magma give off highly alkaline fluids rich in sodium as they solidify, and the hot, reactive fluid replaces much of the mineral content in the aureole with sodium-rich minerals. [59] A special type of contact metamorphism, associated with fossil fuel fires, is known as pyrometamorphism . [60] [61]",

        "text": "Metamorphic facies are recognizable terranes or zones with an assemblage of key minerals that were in equilibrium under specific range of temperature and pressure during a metamorphic event. The facies are named after the metamorphic rock formed under those facies conditions from basalt . [79] The particular mineral assemblage is somewhat dependent on the composition of that protolith, so that (for example) the amphibolite facies of a marble will not be identical with the amphibolite facies of a pellite. However, the facies are defined such that metamorphic rock with as broad a range of compositions as is practical can be assigned to a particular facies. The present definition of metamorphic facies is largely based on the work of the Finnish geologist, Pentti Eskola in 1921, with refinements based on subsequent experimental work. Eskola drew upon the zonal schemes, based on index minerals, that were pioneered by the British geologist, George Barrow . [12] The metamorphic facies is not usually considered when classifying metamorphic rock based on protolith, mineral mode, or texture. However, a few metamorphic facies produce rock of such distinctive character that the facies name is used for the rock when more precise classification is not possible. The chief examples are amphibolite and eclogite . The British Geological Survey strongly discourages use of granulite as a classification for rock metamorphosed to the granulite facies. Instead, such rock will often be classified as a granofels. [76] However, this is not universally accepted. [77] See diagram for more detail.",

        "text": "Metamorphic processes act to bring the protolith closer to thermodynamic equilibrium , which is its state of maximum stability. For example, shear stress (nonhydrodynamic stress) is incompatible with thermodynamic equilibrium, so sheared rock will tend to deform in ways that relieve the shear stress. [81] The most stable assemblage of minerals for a rock of a given composition is that which minimizes the Gibbs free energy [82] G ( p , T ) = U + p V − T S {\\displaystyle G(p,T)=U+pV-TS} where: In other words, a metamorphic reaction will take place only if it lowers the total Gibbs free energy of the protolith. Recrystallization to coarser crystals lowers the Gibbs free energy by reducing surface energy, [18] while phase changes and neocrystallization reduce the bulk Gibbs free energy. A reaction will begin at the temperature and pressure where the Gibbs free energy of the reagents becomes greater than that of the products. [83] A  mineral phase will generally be more stable if it has a lower internal energy, reflecting tighter binding between its atoms. Phases with a higher density (expressed as a lower molar volume V ) are more stable at higher pressure, while minerals with a less ordered structure (expressed as a higher entropy S ) are favored at high temperature. Thus andalusite is stable only at low pressure, since it has the lowest density of any aluminium silicate polymorph, while sillimanite is the stable form at higher temperatures, since it has the least ordered structure. [84] The Gibbs free energy of a particular mineral at a specified temperature and pressure can be expressed by various analytic formulas. These are calibrated against experimentally measured properties and phase boundaries of mineral assemblages. The equilibrium mineral assemblage for a given bulk composition of rock at a specified temperature and pressure can then be calculated on a computer. [85] [86] However, it is often very useful to represent equilibrium mineral assemblages using various kinds of diagrams. [87] These include petrogenetic grids [88] [89] and compatibility diagrams (compositional phase diagrams.) [90] [91]",

Dissolved substances are transported out of the rock by the fluids while new substances are brought in by fresh fluids. This can obviously change the mineral makeup of the rock. [10] However, changes in the mineral composition can take place even when the bulk composition of the rock does not change. This is possible because all minerals are stable only within certain limits of temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. For example, at atmospheric pressure, the mineral kyanite transforms to andalusite at a temperature of about 190 °C (374 °F). Andalusite, in turn, transforms to sillimanite when the temperature reaches about 800 °C (1,470 °F). All three have the identical composition, Al 2 SiO 5 . Likewise, forsterite is stable over a broad range of pressure and temperature in marble , but is converted to pyroxene at elevated pressure and temperature in more silicate-rich rock containing plagioclase , with which the forsterite reacts chemically. [11] Many complex high-temperature reactions may take place between minerals without them melting, and each mineral assemblage produced indicates the temperatures and pressures at the time of metamorphism. These reactions are possible because of rapid diffusion of atoms at elevated temperature. Pore fluid between mineral grains can be an important medium through which atoms are exchanged. [10]",

Atoms in the interior of a crystal are surrounded by a stable arrangement of neighboring atoms. This is partially missing at the surface of the crystal, producing a surface energy that makes the surface thermodynamically unstable. Recrystallization to coarser crystals reduces the surface area and so minimizes the surface energy. [17] Although grain coarsening is a common result of metamorphism, rock that is intensely deformed may eliminate strain energy by recrystallizing as a fine-grained rock called mylonite . Certain kinds of rock, such as those rich in quartz, carbonate minerals , or olivine, are particularly prone to form mylonites, while feldspar and garnet are resistant to mylonitization. [18]",

        "text": "Many kinds of metamorphic rocks show a distinctive layering called foliation (derived from the Latin word folia , meaning \"leaves\"). Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during recrystallization. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite , to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage . Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale , and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates. [19] The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone , the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite , which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss , which is coarse to very coarse-grained. [20] Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.",

        "section": "Classification",
        "text": "Metamorphic rocks are one of the three great divisions of all rock types, and so there is a great variety of metamorphic rock types. In general, if the protolith of a metamorphic rock can be determined, the rock is described by adding the prefix meta- to the protolith rock name. For example, if the protolith is known to be basalt , the rock will be described as a metabasalt. Likewise, a metamorphic rock whose protolith is known to be a conglomerate will be described as a metaconglomerate . For a metamorphic rock to be classified in this manner, the protolith should be identifiable from the characteristics of the metamorphic rock itself, and not inferred from other information. [21] [22] [23] Under the British Geological Survey's classification system, if all that can be determined about the protolith is its general type, such as sedimentary or volcanic, the classification is based on the mineral mode (the volume percentages of different minerals in the rock). Metasedimentary rocks are divided into carbonate-rich rock (metacarbonates or calcsilicate-rocks) or carbonate-poor rocks, and the latter are further classified by the relative abundance of mica in their composition. This ranges from low-mica psammite through semipelite to high-mica pelite . Psammites composed mostly of quartz are classified as quartzite. Metaigneous rocks are classified similarly to igneous rocks, by silica content, from meta-ultramafic-rock (which is very low in silica) to metafelsic-rock (with a high silica content). [22] Where the mineral mode cannot be determined, as is often the case when rock is first examined in the field , then classification must be based on texture. The textural types are: A hornfels is a granofels that is known to result from contact metamorphism. A slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that easily splits into thin plates but shows no obvious compositional layering. The term is used only when very little else is known about the rock that would allow a more definite classification. Textural classifications may be prefixed to indicate a sedimentary protolith ( para- , such as paraschist) or igneous protolith ( ortho- , such as orthogneiss). When nothing is known about the protolith, the textural name is used without a prefix. For example, a schist is a rock with schistose texture whose protolith is uncertain. [22] Special classifications exist for metamorphic rocks with a volcaniclastic protolith or formed along a fault or through hydrothermal circulation . A few special names are used for rocks of unknown protolith but known modal composition, such as marble, eclogite , or amphibolite . [22] Special names may also be applied more generally to rocks dominated by a single mineral, or with a distinctive composition or mode or origin. Special names still in wide use include amphibolite, greenschist , phyllite, marble, serpentinite , eclogite, migmatite , skarn , granulite , mylonite, and slate. [23] The basic classification can be supplemented by terms describing mineral content or texture. For example, a metabasalt showing weak schistosity might be described as a gneissic metabasalt, and a pelite containing abundant staurolite might be described as a staurolite pelite. [22] [23]",

        "text": "Contact metamorphism takes place when magma is injected into the surrounding solid rock ( country rock ). [29] The changes that occur are greatest wherever the magma comes into contact with the rock because the temperatures are highest at this boundary and decrease with distance from it. Around the igneous rock that forms from the cooling magma is a metamorphosed zone called a contact aureole . Aureoles may show all degrees of metamorphism from the contact area to unmetamorphosed (unchanged) country rock some distance away. The formation of important ore minerals may occur by the process of metasomatism at or near the contact zone. [39] Contact aureoles around large plutons may be as much as several kilometers wide. [40] The term hornfels is often used by geologists to signify those fine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. [41] The contact aureole typically shows little deformation, and so hornfels is usually devoid of schistosity and forms a tough, equigranular rock. If the rock was originally banded or foliated (as, for example, a laminated sandstone or a foliated calc- schist ) this character may not be obliterated, and a banded hornfels is the product. [41] Contact metamorphism close to the surface produces distinctive low-pressure metamorphic minerals, [29] such as spinel , andalusite, vesuvianite , or wollastonite . [42] Similar changes may be induced in shales by the burning of coal seams. [41] This produces a rock type named clinker . [43] There is also a tendency for metasomatism between the igneous magma and sedimentary country rock, whereby the chemicals in each are exchanged or introduced into the other.  In that case, hybrid rocks called skarn arise. [41] [44]",

The types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which it was formed. Most rocks contain silicate minerals , compounds that include silica tetrahedra in their crystal lattice , and account for about one-third of all known mineral species and about 95% of the earth's crust . [6] The proportion of silica in rocks and minerals is a major factor in determining their names and properties. [7] Rocks are classified according to characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition, permeability , texture of the constituent particles, and particle size . These physical properties are the result of the processes that formed the rocks. [5] Over the course of time, rocks can be transformed from one type into another, as described by a geological model called the rock cycle . This transformation produces three general classes of rock: igneous , sedimentary and metamorphic . Those three classes are subdivided into many groups. There are, however, no hard-and-fast boundaries between allied rocks. By increase or decrease in the proportions of their minerals, they pass through gradations from one to the other; the distinctive structures of one kind of rock may thus be traced, gradually merging into those of another. Hence the definitions adopted in rock names simply correspond to selected points in a continuously graduated series. [8]",

This magma may be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet 's mantle or crust . Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. [10] : 591–599 Igneous rocks are divided into two main categories: Magmas tend to become richer in silica as they rise towards the Earth's surface, a process called magma differentiation . This occurs both because minerals low in silica crystallize out of the magma as it begins to cool ( Bowen's reaction series ) and because the magma assimilates some of the crustal rock through which it ascends ( country rock ), and crustal rock tends to be high in silica. Silica content is thus the most important chemical criterion for classifying igneous rock. [7] The content of alkali metal oxides is next in importance. [11] About 65% of the Earth's crust by volume consists of igneous rocks. Of these, 66% are basalt and gabbro , 16% are granite, and 17% granodiorite and diorite . Only 0.6% are syenite and 0.3% are ultramafic . The oceanic crust is 99% basalt, which is an igneous rock of mafic composition. Granite and similar rocks, known as granitoids , dominate the continental crust . [12] [13]",

The particulate matter then undergoes compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures and pressures ( diagenesis ).

This process is called metamorphism , meaning to \"change in form\". The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone. The original rock, known as the protolith , transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals, by recrystallization . [5] The temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher than those found at the Earth's surface: temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C and pressures greater than 1500 bars. [18] This occurs, for example, when continental plates collide. [19] : 31–33, 134–139 Metamorphic rocks compose 27.4% of the crust by volume. [13] The three major classes of metamorphic rock are based upon the formation mechanism. An intrusion of magma that heats the surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism—a temperature-dominated transformation. Pressure metamorphism occurs when sediments are buried deep under the ground; pressure is dominant, and temperature plays a smaller role. This is termed burial metamorphism, and it can result in rocks such as jade . Where both heat and pressure play a role, the mechanism is termed regional metamorphism. This is typically found in mountain-building regions. [7] Depending on the structure, metamorphic rocks are divided into two general categories. Those that possess a texture are referred to as foliated ; the remainders are termed non-foliated. The name of the rock is then determined based on the types of minerals present. Schists are foliated rocks that are primarily composed of lamellar minerals such as micas . A gneiss has visible bands of differing lightness , with a common example being the granite gneiss. Other varieties of foliated rock include slates , phyllites , and mylonite . Familiar examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks include marble , soapstone , and serpentine . This branch contains quartzite —a metamorphosed form of sandstone —and hornfels . [7]",

In other words, it is a metamorphic rock composed of mineral grains easily seen with the unaided eye, which form obvious compositional layers, but which has only a weak tendency to fracture along these layers. In Europe, the term has been more widely applied to any coarse, mica -poor, high-grade metamorphic rock. [1] The British Geological Survey (BGS) and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) both use gneiss as a broad textural category for medium- to coarse-grained metamorphic rock that shows poorly developed schistosity, with compositional layering over 5 millimeters (0.20 in) thick [2] and tending to split into plates over 1 centimeter (0.39 in) thick. [3] Neither definition depends on composition or origin, though rocks poor in platy minerals are more likely to produce gneissose texture. Gneissose rocks thus are largely recrystallized but do not carry large quantities of micas, chlorite or other platy minerals. [4] Metamorphic rock showing stronger schistosity is classified as schist, while metamorphic rock devoid of schistosity is called a granofels . [2] [3] Gneisses that are metamorphosed igneous rocks or their equivalent are termed granite gneisses, diorite gneisses, and so forth. Gneiss rocks may also be named after a characteristic component such as garnet gneiss, biotite gneiss, albite gneiss, and so forth. Orthogneiss designates a gneiss derived from an igneous rock , and paragneiss is one from a sedimentary rock .

[6] The darker bands have relatively more mafic minerals (those containing more magnesium and iron ). The lighter bands contain relatively more felsic minerals (minerals such as feldspar or quartz , which contain more of the lighter elements, such as aluminium , sodium , and potassium ). [7] The banding is developed at high temperature when the rock is more strongly compressed in one direction than in other directions ( nonhydrostatic stress ). The bands develop perpendicular to the direction of greatest compression, also called the shortening direction, as platy minerals are rotated or recrystallized into parallel layers. [8] A common cause of nonhydrodynamic stress is the subjection of the protolith (the original rock material that undergoes metamorphism) to extreme shearing force, a sliding force similar to the pushing of the top of a deck of cards in one direction, and the bottom of the deck in the other direction. [6] These forces stretch out the rock like a plastic , and the original material is spread out into sheets. Per the polar decomposition theorem , the deformation produced by such shearing force is equivalent to rotation of the rock combined with shortening in one direction and extension in another. [9] Some banding is formed from original rock material (protolith) that is subjected to extreme temperature and pressure and is composed of alternating layers of sandstone (lighter) and shale (darker), which is metamorphosed into bands of quartzite and mica. [6] Another cause of banding is \"metamorphic differentiation\", which separates different materials into different layers through chemical reactions, a process not fully understood. [6]",

[1] [20] An electron microprobe is usually used in geothermobarometry to measure the distribution of components in the minerals and give precise determination of the chemical equilibrium within the specimen. [20] Geothermobarometry is a combination of: Geothermometers are usually represented by exchange reactions , which are sensitive to temperature but with little effect under changing pressure, such as exchange of Fe 2+ and Mg 2+ between garnet - biotite reaction: [1] Geobarometers are typically occurred as net-transfer reactions , which are sensitive to pressure but have little change with temperature, such as garnet - plagioclase - muscovite - biotite reaction that involves a significant volume reduction upon high pressure: [1] Since mineral assemblages at equilibrium are dependent on pressures and temperatures, by measuring the composition of the coexisting minerals, together with using suitable activity models, the P-T conditions experienced by the rock can be determined. [1] After one equilibrium constant is found, a line would be plotted on the P-T diagram. [20] As different equilibrium constants of mineral assemblages would occur as lines with different slopes in the P-T diagram, therefore, by finding the intersection of at least two lines in the P-T diagram, the P-T condition of the specimen can be obtained. [1] Despite the usefulness of geothermobarometry, special attention should be paid to whether the mineral assemblages represent an equilibrium, any occurrence of retrograde equilibrium in the rock, and appropriateness of calibration of the results.

[21] In a changing environment, minerals would be unstable and alter itself to reduce its Gibbs free energy to achieve stable states. [21] However, sometimes the mineral core has not reached equilibrium upon the environmental change and zoning occurs. [21] Zoning is also found in other minerals such as plagioclase and fluorite . [1] In practice, garnet is commonly used in the study of metamorphic rocks due to its refractory nature. [22] In past studies, garnet is found to be a mineral that is stable under a wide range of P-T conditions, meanwhile chemically displays responses (e.g. ions exchange ) to the P-T variations throughout its metamorphic history without reaching complete equilibrium. [22] The non-equilibriated garnet formed previously are often zoned by younger garnet. [1] Therefore, many past P-T characteristics are preserved in the zoned areas. Electron microprobes are used to measure the composition of the garnet zones.

Pseudosection shows different mineral phases for a single rock chemical composition, [25] while petrogenetic grid shows a set of reactions under different P-T conditions that would occur for a phase diagram.

[25] There are two geochemical methods in determining the bulk-rock composition: Both methods have their advantages and limitations. The XRF method provides a non-biased estimation, but may neglect the proportion of existing minerals in the rock.

[1] [39] It works on the temperature variation of the earth crust over time based on rate of heat transfer and diffusion along the disturbed geothermal gradient (normal heat distribution in the ground). [1] [2] Thermal modeling does not give the actual geological time. [1] However, it provides accurate estimation of the duration of the thermal events. [1] [2] An advantage of thermal modeling is that it provides a holistic estimation of the duration of different stages of metamorphism, which is somehow difficult to completely extract from geochronological methods. [1] The model simulation involves solving the continuous time-dependent differential heat transfer equation by its approximate discrete finite difference form using computer programs such as FORTRAN . [1] [26] After the equations are set, a grid of nodes is generated for calculation of each point. [1] [40] Boundary conditions (normally temperature of the geothermal gradients) are input into the equations to calculate the temperature at boundaries. [1] Results are compared with petrological experimental results for validation. [1] By combining petrological methods and thermal modeling techniques, the understanding of metamorphic processes due to tectonic events is facilitated. [1] [39] Petrological results provide realistic variables to be plugged into a model simulation, while numerical modeling techniques often place constraints on the possible tectonic environments.

        "text": "P-T-t paths can be used to estimate possible structures in the field as heat would transfer in small scale advective heat flow during thrusting and folding of metamorphic rocks. [1] [3] For example, during the formation of fault-bend-fold , the rocks in the lower segment (footwall) are heated due to contact with the hotter upper thrust sheet (hanging wall), while the upper thrust sheet is cooling because of losing heat in a downward direction. [52] [53] Thus, the lower segment and the upper thrust sheet are undergoing prograde metamorphism and retrograde metamorphism respectively. [53] Nevertheless, special attention should be taken to the effect of multiple thrusting such as duplexes, where the initial lower plate in an earlier thrust would become the upper plate in a later thrusting event. [52] Depending on the location of the rock, a variety of complex P-T trajectories can be found, which may make interpretation of a terrain challenging. [52]",
