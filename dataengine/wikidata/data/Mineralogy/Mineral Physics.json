[6] Beneath the Earth's crust lies the mantle which is heated by the radioactive decay of heavy elements . The mantle is not quite solid and consists of magma which is in a state of semi-perpetual convection . This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics. [7] [8] [9] [10] Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called divergent boundaries , those where it is brought back into the Earth are convergent boundaries and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as transform (or conservative) boundaries. [8] [10] [11] Earthquakes result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the earth as part of subduction. [12] Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of seafloor spreading , new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the mantle to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through subduction , oceanic crust and lithosphere vehemently returns to the convecting mantle. [8] [10] [13] Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the asthenosphere melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface—giving birth to volcanoes. [8] [12]",

[14] The troposphere , stratosphere , mesosphere , thermosphere , and exosphere are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. 75% of the mass in the atmosphere is located within the troposphere, the lowest layer. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% nitrogen , 20.9% oxygen , and 0.92% argon , and small amounts of other gases including CO 2 and water vapor. [15] Water vapor and CO 2 cause the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through the greenhouse effect . [16] This makes Earth's surface warm enough for liquid water and life. In addition to trapping heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding the Earth's surface from cosmic rays . [17] The magnetic field —created by the internal motions of the core—produces the magnetosphere which protects Earth's atmosphere from the solar wind .

These can be classified into density (often given as specific gravity ); measures of mechanical cohesion ( hardness , tenacity , cleavage , fracture , parting ); macroscopic visual properties ( luster , color, streak , luminescence , diaphaneity ); magnetic and electric properties; radioactivity and solubility in hydrogen chloride ( H Cl ). [5] : 97–113 [8] : 39–53 Hardness is determined by comparison with other minerals. In the Mohs scale , a standard set of minerals are numbered in order of increasing hardness from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). A harder mineral will scratch a softer, so an unknown mineral can be placed in this scale, by which minerals; it scratches and which scratch it. A few minerals such as calcite and kyanite have a hardness that depends significantly on direction. [9] : 254–255 Hardness can also be measured on an absolute scale using a sclerometer ; compared to the absolute scale, the Mohs scale is nonlinear. [8] : 52 Tenacity refers to the way a mineral behaves, when it is broken, crushed, bent or torn. A mineral can be brittle , malleable , sectile , ductile , flexible or elastic . An important influence on tenacity is the type of chemical bond ( e.g., ionic or metallic ). [9] : 255–256 Of the other measures of mechanical cohesion, cleavage is the tendency to break along certain crystallographic planes. It is described by the quality ( e.g. , perfect or fair) and the orientation of the plane in crystallographic nomenclature. Parting is the tendency to break along planes of weakness due to pressure, twinning or exsolution . Where these two kinds of break do not occur, fracture is a less orderly form that may be conchoidal (having smooth curves resembling the interior of a shell), fibrous , splintery , hackly (jagged with sharp edges), or uneven . [9] : 253–254 If the mineral is well crystallized, it will also have a distinctive crystal habit (for example, hexagonal, columnar, botryoidal ) that reflects the crystal structure or internal arrangement of atoms. [8] : 40–41 It is also affected by crystal defects and twinning . Many crystals are polymorphic , having more than one possible crystal structure depending on factors such as pressure and temperature. [5] : 66–68 [8] : 126",

[11] : 91–92 The lattice remains unchanged by certain symmetry operations about any given point in the lattice: reflection , rotation , inversion , and rotary inversion , a combination of rotation and reflection. Together, they make up a mathematical object called a crystallographic point group or crystal class . There are 32 possible crystal classes. In addition, there are operations that displace all the points: translation , screw axis , and glide plane . In combination with the point symmetries, they form 230 possible space groups .

Diffraction , the constructive and destructive interference between waves scattered at different atoms, leads to distinctive patterns of high and low intensity that depend on the geometry of the crystal.

In July 2006, it was merged with the Commission on Classification of Minerals to form the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature, and Classification. [13] There are over 6,000 named and unnamed minerals, and about 100 are discovered each year.

[22] This database integrates the crowd-sourced site Mindat.org , which has over 690,000 mineral-locality pairs, with the official IMA list of approved minerals and age data from geological publications. [23] This database makes it possible to apply statistics to answer new questions, an approach that has been called mineral ecology . One such question is how much of mineral evolution is deterministic and how much the result of chance . Some factors are deterministic, such as the chemical nature of a mineral and conditions for its stability ; but mineralogy can also be affected by the processes that determine a planet's composition. In a 2015 paper, Robert Hazen and others analyzed the number of minerals involving each element as a function of its abundance. They found that Earth, with over 4800 known minerals and 72 elements, has a power law relationship. The Moon, with only 63 minerals and 24 elements (based on a much smaller sample) has essentially the same relationship. This implies that, given the chemical composition of the planet, one could predict the more common minerals. However, the distribution has a long tail , with 34% of the minerals having been found at only one or two locations. The model predicts that thousands more mineral species may await discovery or have formed and then been lost to erosion, burial or other processes. This implies a role of chance in the formation of rare minerals occur. [24] [25] [26] [27] In another use of big data sets, network theory was applied to a dataset of carbon minerals, revealing new patterns in their diversity and distribution. The analysis can show which minerals tend to coexist and what conditions (geological, physical, chemical and biological) are associated with them. This information can be used to predict where to look for new deposits and even new mineral species. [28] [29] [30]",

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. Molecular biology is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life.

In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the field's principles and laws. Physics relies heavily on mathematics as the logical framework for formulating and quantifying principles. The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with philosophy gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include Isaac Newton 's theory of universal gravitation and classical mechanics , an understanding of electricity and its relation to magnetism , Einstein 's theories of special and general relativity , the development of thermodynamics , and the quantum mechanical model of atomic and subatomic physics. The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as quantum mechanics and theoretical physics , applied physics and optics . Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being \"universalists\" like Isaac Newton , Albert Einstein and Lev Landau , who worked in multiple areas.",

Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Astronomers of early civilizations performed methodical observations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts have been found from much earlier periods. There are two types of astronomy: observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring and analyzing data, mainly using basic principles of physics while Theoretical astronomy is oriented towards the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. This discipline is the science of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere . It is concerned with the evolution, physics , chemistry , meteorology , geology , and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe . Astronomy includes the examination, study, and modeling of stars, planets, comets. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the interstellar medium ). There is considerable overlap with physics and in some areas of earth science . There are also interdisciplinary fields such as astrophysics , planetary sciences , and cosmology , along with allied disciplines such as space physics and astrochemistry . While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was Galileo 's introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail. The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with Newton 's development of celestial mechanics and the laws of gravitation , although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as Kepler . By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the spectroscope and photography , along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.",

Originally developed through the field of metallurgy , the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics, and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating the structure of materials with their properties. It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of forensic engineering (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and failure analysis , the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology. The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their properties . Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and how it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics , govern a material's microstructure , and thus its properties.",

The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramid-like rhombohedrons at each end. In nature, quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive . [22] [23] Well-formed crystals typically form as a druse (a layer of crystals lining a void), of which quartz geodes are particularly fine examples. [24] The crystals are attached at one end to the enclosing rock, and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance, within gypsum . [25] α-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, space group P 3 1 21 or P 3 2 21 (space group 152 or 154 resp.) depending on the chirality. Above 573 °C (846 K; 1,063 °F), α-quartz in P 3 1 21 becomes the more symmetric hexagonal P 6 4 22 (space group 181), and α-quartz in P 3 2 21 goes to space group P 6 2 22 (no. 180). [26] These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both α-quartz and β-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO 4 tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between α- and β-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without a change in the way they are linked. [22] [27] However, there is a significant change in volume during this transition, [ clarification needed ] and this can result in significant microfracturing in ceramics [28] and in rocks of the Earth's crust.

The most important distinction between types of quartz is that of macrocrystalline (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties ( aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite .

As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538 °C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, which has a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure . As it cools further to 1394 °C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite . At 912 °C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope. [10] The physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, [11] [12] because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into another hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron . The higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher pressure. Some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable β phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K. It is supposed to have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure. [13] (Confusingly, the term \"β-iron\" is sometimes also used to refer to α-iron above its Curie point, when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal structure has not changed.

[19] This happens because the orbitals of those two electrons (d z 2 and d x 2 − y 2 ) do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice, and therefore are not involved in metallic bonding. [10] In the absence of an external source of magnetic field, the atoms get spontaneously partitioned into magnetic domains , about 10 micrometers across, [20] such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins, but some domains have other orientations. Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field. Application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This effect is exploited in devices that need to channel magnetic fields to fulfill design function, such as electrical transformers , magnetic recording heads, and electric motors . Impurities, lattice defects , or grain and particle boundaries can \"pin\" the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed – thus turning the iron object into a (permanent) magnet . [19] Similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites including the mineral magnetite , a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide Fe 3 O 4 (although the atomic-scale mechanism, ferrimagnetism , is somewhat different). Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization ( lodestones ) provided the earliest compasses for navigation. Particles of magnetite were extensively used in magnetic recording media such as core memories , magnetic tapes , floppies , and disks , until they were replaced by cobalt -based materials.",

Of these stable isotopes, only 57 Fe has a nuclear spin (− 1 ⁄ 2 ). The nuclide 54 Fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54 Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×10 22 years has been established. [21] 60 Fe is an extinct radionuclide of long half-life (2.6 million years). [22] It is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is its granddaughter, the stable nuclide 60 Ni . [21] Much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the nucleosynthesis of 60 Fe through studies of meteorites and ore formation. In the last decade, advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron. Much of this work is driven by the Earth and planetary science communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging. [23] In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut, a correlation between the concentration of 60 Ni, the granddaughter of 60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60 Fe at the time of formation of the Solar System . Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60 Fe, along with that released by 26 Al , contributed to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of 60 Ni present in extraterrestrial material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the Solar System . [24] The most abundant iron isotope 56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis . [25] Since 56 Ni (14 alpha particles ) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process ), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60 Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56 Ni, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56 Co, and then to stable 56 Fe. As such, iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants , and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth . [26] It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight . [26] [27] Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe , and the most common refractory element. [28] Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62 Ni , which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56 Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56 Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62 Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. [29] Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56 Fe nuclei. [26] In the far future of the universe, assuming that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56 Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron. [30]",

However, both the Earth's inner and outer core , which together account for 35% of the mass of the whole Earth, are believed to consist largely of an iron alloy, possibly with nickel . Electric currents in the liquid outer core are believed to be the origin of the Earth's magnetic field . The other terrestrial planets ( Mercury , Venus , and Mars ) as well as the Moon are believed to have a metallic core consisting mostly of iron. The M-type asteroids are also believed to be partly or mostly made of metallic iron alloy. The rare iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. Items made of cold-worked meteoritic iron have been found in various archaeological sites dating from a time when iron smelting had not yet been developed; and the Inuit in Greenland have been reported to use iron from the Cape York meteorite for tools and hunting weapons. [33] About 1 in 20 meteorites consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). [34] Native iron is also rarely found in basalts that have formed from magmas that have come into contact with carbon-rich sedimentary rocks, which have reduced the oxygen fugacity sufficiently for iron to crystallize. This is known as telluric iron and is described from a few localities, such as Disko Island in West Greenland, Yakutia in Russia and Bühl in Germany. [35]",

        "text": "While iron is the most abundant element on Earth, most of this iron is concentrated in the inner and outer cores. [40] [41] The fraction of iron that is in Earth's crust only amounts to about 5% of the overall mass of the crust and is thus only the fourth most abundant element in that layer (after oxygen , silicon , and aluminium ). [42] Most of the iron in the crust is combined with various other elements to form many iron minerals . An important class is the iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), and siderite (FeCO 3 ), which are the major ores of iron . Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite . [43] [44] During weathering , iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as iron(III) oxide . [45] Large deposits of iron are banded iron formations , a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor shale and chert . The banded iron formations were laid down in the time between 3,700 million years ago and 1,800 million years ago . [46] [47] Materials containing finely ground iron(III) oxides or oxide-hydroxides, such as ochre , have been used as yellow, red, and brown pigments since pre-historical times. They contribute as well to the color of various rocks and clays , including entire geological formations like the Painted Hills in Oregon and the Buntsandstein (\"colored sandstone\", British Bunter ). [48] Through Eisensandstein (a jurassic 'iron sandstone', e.g. from Donzdorf in Germany) [49] and Bath stone in the UK, iron compounds are responsible for the yellowish color of many historical buildings and sculptures. [50] The proverbial red color of the surface of Mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich regolith . [51] Significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS 2 ), but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not exploited. [52] In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. [53] According to the International Resource Panel 's Metal Stocks in Society report , the global stock of iron in use in society is 2,200 kg per capita. More-developed countries differ in this respect from less-developed countries (7,000–14,000 vs 2,000 kg per capita). [54]",

Although Fe 3+ has a d 5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn 2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe 3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. [69] On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion [Fe(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.

        "text": "Due to its electronic structure, iron has a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry. Many coordination compounds of iron are known. A typical six-coordinate anion is hexachloroferrate(III), [FeCl 6 ] 3− , found in the mixed salt tetrakis(methylammonium) hexachloroferrate(III) chloride . [71] [72] Complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have geometric isomers . For example, the trans - chlorohydridobis(bis-1,2-(diphenylphosphino)ethane)iron(II) complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the Fe( dppe ) 2 moiety . [73] [74] The ferrioxalate ion with three oxalate ligands displays helical chirality with its two non-superposable geometries labelled Λ (lambda) for the left-handed screw axis and Δ (delta) for the right-handed screw axis, in line with IUPAC conventions. [69] Potassium ferrioxalate is used in chemical actinometry and along with its sodium salt undergoes photoreduction applied in old-style photographic processes. The dihydrate of iron(II) oxalate has a polymeric structure with co-planar oxalate ions bridging between iron centres with the water of crystallisation located forming the caps of each octahedron, as illustrated below. [75] Iron(III) complexes are quite similar to those of chromium (III) with the exception of iron(III)'s preference for O -donor instead of N -donor ligands. The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe–O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for phenols or enols . For example, in the ferric chloride test , used to determine the presence of phenols, iron(III) chloride reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex: [69] Among the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are the most stable, with the colorless [FeF 5 (H 2 O)] 2− being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in [FeCl 4 ] − ; [FeBr 4 ] − and [FeI 4 ] − are reduced easily to iron(II). Thiocyanate is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H 2 O) 5 ] 2+ . Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the spectrochemical series such as cyanide . An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3− . Iron shows a great variety of electronic spin states , including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to 5 ⁄ 2 (5 unpaired electrons). This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin. [65] Iron(II) complexes are less stable than iron(III) complexes but the preference for O -donor ligands is less marked, so that for example [Fe(NH 3 ) 6 ] 2+ is known while [Fe(NH 3 ) 6 ] 3+ is not. They have a tendency to be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used. [70]",

Prussian blue or \"ferric ferrocyanide\", Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 , is an old and well-known iron-cyanide complex, extensively used as pigment and in several other applications. Its formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ as they react (respectively) with potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide to form Prussian blue. [61] Another old example of an organoiron compound is iron pentacarbonyl , Fe(CO) 5 , in which a neutral iron atom is bound to the carbon atoms of five carbon monoxide molecules. The compound can be used to make carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives triiron dodecacarbonyl , Fe 3 (CO) 12 , a complex with a cluster of three iron atoms at its core. Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate , is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state. [76] A landmark in this field was the discovery in 1951 of the remarkably stable sandwich compound ferrocene Fe(C 5 H 5 ) 2 , by Pauson and Kealy [77] and independently by Miller and colleagues, [78] whose surprising molecular structure was determined only a year later by Woodward and Wilkinson [79] and Fischer . [80] Ferrocene is still one of the most important tools and models in this class. [81] Iron-centered organometallic species are used as catalysts . The Knölker complex , for example, is a transfer hydrogenation catalyst for ketones . [82]",

        "text": "α-Iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 °C). [131] Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 °C). This form of iron is used in the type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment. [20] Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon [132] and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur , silicon and phosphorus . Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese . [117] Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. [10] Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy. [16] \"White\" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite , or iron carbide (Fe 3 C). [16] This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723 °C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and α-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite . The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-αFe mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture. [16] In gray iron the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. [133] A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron , is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material. [133] Wrought iron contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic. [132] Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by mild steel , which corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less, [134] with small amounts of manganese , sulfur , phosphorus , and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as chromium , vanadium , molybdenum , nickel, tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel . Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed ' HSLA ' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost. [134] [135] [136] Alloys with high purity elemental makeups (such as alloys of electrolytic iron ) have specifically enhanced properties such as ductility , tensile strength , toughness , fatigue strength , heat resistance, and corrosion resistance. Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead , it is much stronger mechanically. [137] The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way, a cost amounting to over 1% of the world's economy.

The mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows: [138] The electrolyte is usually iron(II) sulfate in urban areas (formed when atmospheric sulfur dioxide attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas.

        "text": "Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes, sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron. [9] In particular, bacteria have evolved very high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores . [152] [153] [154] After uptake in human cells , iron storage is precisely regulated. [9] [155] A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin , which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells. [9] [156] Transferrin contains Fe 3+ in the middle of a distorted octahedron, bonded to one nitrogen, three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the Fe 3+ ion: it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up Fe 3+ ions even from the most stable complexes. At the bone marrow, transferrin is reduced from Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin. [148] The most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds (biological iron molecules) are the heme proteins : examples are hemoglobin , myoglobin , and cytochrome P450 . [9] These compounds participate in transporting gases, building enzymes , and transferring electrons . [148] Metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors . Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin . [148] Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase , [157] lipoxygenases , [158] and IRE-BP . [159] Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin , which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose , generating energy. [9] Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide , produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. [148] In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. [148] When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe 2+ ion at the center of the heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration . It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe 2+ ion about 55 picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue. [148] When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe 2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. [148] Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O 2 –Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ , and the destruction of hemoglobin. This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. [148] Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue. [148] As described by the Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr , the father of Niels Bohr ), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide. [148] Carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin . This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide , but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a . [148] The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen—with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide. [148] Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate . Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows: [148] Although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron–sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin , which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron–sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins , which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes. [148] The ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles . Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times. [161]",

The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection.

[26] The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted dipole , but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the geomagnetic pole stays near the geographic pole , but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These geomagnetic reversals , analyzed within a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale , contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the Laschamp event occurring 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period . Geologists observed geomagnetic reversal recorded in volcanic rocks, through magnetostratigraphy correlation (see natural remanent magnetization ) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on seafloor spreading , a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of magnetostratigraphy , which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales.

        "text": "Evidence from seismology , heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity ( 5.515 ) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ( 2.7–3.3 ), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R 2 , compared to 0.4 M R 2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation . The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals. [10] Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core , however, is solid because of the enormous pressure. [12] Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicates some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core , outer core , mantle, lithosphere and crust . The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle , transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity . [12] The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements . The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see post-perovskite ) and supplemented by seismic tomography . The mantle is mainly composed of silicates , and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions. [10] The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures, it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes plate tectonics possible.",

Most common structural materials include parallelpiped and hexagonal lattice types. [13] New and advanced materials that are being developed include nanomaterials . In single crystals , the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects . Examples of crystal defects consist of dislocations including edges, screws, vacancies, self inter-stitials, and more that are linear, planar, and three dimensional types of defects.

Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure.

The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. [18] Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured. The manufacture of a perfect crystal of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain defects such as precipitates , grain boundaries ( Hall–Petch relationship ), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. [19] The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects and advances in simulation have allowed an increased understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.",

Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, statistical mechanics . The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science.

        "text": "Radical materials advances can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ( casting , rolling , welding , ion implantation , crystal growth , thin-film deposition , sintering , glassblowing , etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as electron microscopy , X-ray diffraction , calorimetry , nuclear microscopy (HEFIB) , Rutherford backscattering , neutron diffraction , small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.). Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced. Solid materials are generally grouped into three basic classifications: ceramics, metals, and polymers. This broad classification is based on the empirical makeup and atomic structure of the solid materials, and most solids fall into one of these broad categories. [26] An item that is often made from each of these materials types is the beverage container. The material types used for beverage containers accordingly provide different advantages and disadvantages, depending on the material used. Ceramic (glass) containers are optically transparent, impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide, relatively inexpensive, and are easily recycled, but are also heavy and fracture easily. Metal (aluminum alloy) is relatively strong, is a good barrier to the diffusion of carbon dioxide, and is easily recycled. However, the cans are opaque, expensive to produce, and are easily dented and punctured. Polymers (polyethylene plastic) are relatively strong, can be optically transparent, are inexpensive and lightweight, and can be recyclable, but are not as impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide as aluminum and glass.",

Many ceramics and glasses exhibit covalent or ionic-covalent bonding with SiO 2 ( silica ) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics – not to be confused with raw, unfired clay – are usually seen in crystalline form. The vast majority of commercial glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At the high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid which solidifies into a disordered state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also used for long-range telecommunication and optical transmission. Scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silicon carbide , and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties. Ceramics can be significantly strengthened for engineering applications using the principle of crack deflection . [27] This process involves the strategic addition of second-phase particles within a ceramic matrix, optimizing their shape, size, and distribution to direct and control crack propagation. This approach enhances fracture toughness, paving the way for the creation of advanced, high-performance ceramics in various industries. [28]",

Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles, which play a key and integral role in NASA's Space Shuttle thermal protection system , which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), the light gray material, which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1,510 °C (2,750 °F) and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. [29] RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin . After curing at high temperature in an autoclave , the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfuryl alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the furfuryl alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reusability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide . Other examples can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a composite material made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc , glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion . These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.",

[30] Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber . Plastics and rubber are the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics in former and in current widespread use include polyethylene , polypropylene , polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene , nylons , polyesters , acrylics , polyurethanes , and polycarbonates . Rubbers include natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, chloroprene , and butadiene rubber . Plastics are generally classified as commodity , specialty and engineering plastics . Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling, packaging , and containers . Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of plasticisers and other additives that it accepts. [31] The term \"additives\" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties. Polycarbonate would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK , ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics. Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc. The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, polyethylene (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted hip joints .",

Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low , mid and high carbon steels . An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00% by weight. For steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. In contrast, certain metal alloys exhibit unique properties where their size and density remain unchanged across a range of temperatures. [32] Cast iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00%, but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium . Nickel and molybdenum are typically also added in stainless steels. Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium , titanium , copper and magnesium . Copper alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age ), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength to weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. [33] These materials are ideal for situations where high strength to weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.",

Thus, materials science and engineering emerged in many ways: renaming and/or combining existing metallurgy and ceramics engineering departments; splitting from existing solid state physics research (itself growing into condensed matter physics ); pulling in relatively new polymer engineering and polymer science ; recombining from the previous, as well as chemistry , chemical engineering , mechanical engineering , and electrical engineering ; and more. The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as for applications field. Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers (or other applied fields) because usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education. Materials physics is the use of physics to describe the physical properties of materials. It is a synthesis of physical sciences such as chemistry , solid mechanics , solid state physics , and materials science. Materials physics is considered a subset of condensed matter physics and applies fundamental condensed matter concepts to complex multiphase media, including materials of technological interest. Current fields that materials physicists work in include electronic, optical, and magnetic materials, novel materials and structures, quantum phenomena in materials, nonequilibrium physics, and soft condensed matter physics. New experimental and computational tools are constantly improving how materials systems are modeled and studied and are also fields when materials physicists work in. The field is inherently interdisciplinary , and the materials scientists or engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. Conversely, fields such as life sciences and archaeology can inspire the development of new materials and processes, in bioinspired and paleoinspired approaches. Thus, there remain close relationships with these fields. Conversely, many physicists, chemists and engineers find themselves working in materials science due to the significant overlaps between the fields.",
