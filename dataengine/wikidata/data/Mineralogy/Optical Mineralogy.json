A thin splinter of the rock, about 1 centimetre may be taken; it should be as fresh as possible and free from obvious cracks.  By grinding it on a plate of planed steel or cast iron with a little fine carborundum it is soon rendered flat on one side, and is then transferred to a sheet of plate glass and smoothed with the finest grained emery until all roughness and pits are removed, and the surface is a uniform plane.  The rock chip is then washed, and placed on a copper or iron plate which is heated by a spirit or gas lamp.  A microscopic glass slip is also warmed on this plate with a drop of viscous natural Canada balsam on its surface.  The more volatile ingredients of the balsam are dispelled by the heat, and when that is accomplished the smooth, dry, warm rock is pressed firmly into contact with the glass plate so that the film of balsam intervening may be as thin as possible and free from air bubbles. The preparation is allowed to cool, and the rock chip is again ground down as before, first with carborundum and, when it becomes transparent, with fine emery until the desired thickness is obtained. It is then cleaned, again heated with an additional small amount of balsam, and covered with a cover glass. The labor of grinding the first surface may be avoided by cutting off a smooth slice with an iron disk armed with crushed diamond powder. A second application of the slitter after the first face is smoothed and cemented to the glass will, in expert hands, leave a section of rock so thin as to be transparent. In this way the preparation of a section may require only twenty minutes. [2]",

        "text": "An initial step in identifying a mineral is to examine its physical properties, many of which can be measured on a hand sample. These can be classified into density (often given as specific gravity ); measures of mechanical cohesion ( hardness , tenacity , cleavage , fracture , parting ); macroscopic visual properties ( luster , color, streak , luminescence , diaphaneity ); magnetic and electric properties; radioactivity and solubility in hydrogen chloride ( H Cl ). [5] : 97–113 [8] : 39–53 Hardness is determined by comparison with other minerals. In the Mohs scale , a standard set of minerals are numbered in order of increasing hardness from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). A harder mineral will scratch a softer, so an unknown mineral can be placed in this scale, by which minerals; it scratches and which scratch it. A few minerals such as calcite and kyanite have a hardness that depends significantly on direction. [9] : 254–255 Hardness can also be measured on an absolute scale using a sclerometer ; compared to the absolute scale, the Mohs scale is nonlinear. [8] : 52 Tenacity refers to the way a mineral behaves, when it is broken, crushed, bent or torn. A mineral can be brittle , malleable , sectile , ductile , flexible or elastic . An important influence on tenacity is the type of chemical bond ( e.g., ionic or metallic ). [9] : 255–256 Of the other measures of mechanical cohesion, cleavage is the tendency to break along certain crystallographic planes. It is described by the quality ( e.g. , perfect or fair) and the orientation of the plane in crystallographic nomenclature. Parting is the tendency to break along planes of weakness due to pressure, twinning or exsolution . Where these two kinds of break do not occur, fracture is a less orderly form that may be conchoidal (having smooth curves resembling the interior of a shell), fibrous , splintery , hackly (jagged with sharp edges), or uneven . [9] : 253–254 If the mineral is well crystallized, it will also have a distinctive crystal habit (for example, hexagonal, columnar, botryoidal ) that reflects the crystal structure or internal arrangement of atoms. [8] : 40–41 It is also affected by crystal defects and twinning . Many crystals are polymorphic , having more than one possible crystal structure depending on factors such as pressure and temperature. [5] : 66–68 [8] : 126",

The lattice can be characterized by its symmetries and by the dimensions of the unit cell. These dimensions are represented by three Miller indices . [11] : 91–92 The lattice remains unchanged by certain symmetry operations about any given point in the lattice: reflection , rotation , inversion , and rotary inversion , a combination of rotation and reflection. Together, they make up a mathematical object called a crystallographic point group or crystal class . There are 32 possible crystal classes. In addition, there are operations that displace all the points: translation , screw axis , and glide plane . In combination with the point symmetries, they form 230 possible space groups .

[8] : 54–55 X-rays have wavelengths that are the same order of magnitude as the distances between atoms. Diffraction , the constructive and destructive interference between waves scattered at different atoms, leads to distinctive patterns of high and low intensity that depend on the geometry of the crystal. In a sample that is ground to a powder, the X-rays sample a random distribution of all crystal orientations. [12] Powder diffraction can distinguish between minerals that may appear the same in a hand sample, for example quartz and its polymorphs tridymite and cristobalite .

In July 2006, it was merged with the Commission on Classification of Minerals to form the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature, and Classification. [13] There are over 6,000 named and unnamed minerals, and about 100 are discovered each year. [14] The Manual of Mineralogy places minerals in the following classes: native elements , sulfides , sulfosalts , oxides and hydroxides , halides , carbonates, nitrates and borates , sulfates, chromates, molybdates and tungstates , phosphates, arsenates and vanadates , and silicates .

[22] This database integrates the crowd-sourced site Mindat.org , which has over 690,000 mineral-locality pairs, with the official IMA list of approved minerals and age data from geological publications. [23] This database makes it possible to apply statistics to answer new questions, an approach that has been called mineral ecology . One such question is how much of mineral evolution is deterministic and how much the result of chance . Some factors are deterministic, such as the chemical nature of a mineral and conditions for its stability ; but mineralogy can also be affected by the processes that determine a planet's composition. In a 2015 paper, Robert Hazen and others analyzed the number of minerals involving each element as a function of its abundance. They found that Earth, with over 4800 known minerals and 72 elements, has a power law relationship. The Moon, with only 63 minerals and 24 elements (based on a much smaller sample) has essentially the same relationship. This implies that, given the chemical composition of the planet, one could predict the more common minerals. However, the distribution has a long tail , with 34% of the minerals having been found at only one or two locations. The model predicts that thousands more mineral species may await discovery or have formed and then been lost to erosion, burial or other processes. This implies a role of chance in the formation of rare minerals occur. [24] [25] [26] [27] In another use of big data sets, network theory was applied to a dataset of carbon minerals, revealing new patterns in their diversity and distribution. The analysis can show which minerals tend to coexist and what conditions (geological, physical, chemical and biological) are associated with them. This information can be used to predict where to look for new deposits and even new mineral species. [28] [29] [30]",

        "text": "Much of the work involving polarization preceded the understanding of light as a transverse electromagnetic wave , and this has affected some terminology in use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive index is the same for any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is called \"birefringent\" because it will generally refract a single incoming ray in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different polarizations. This is true of either a uniaxial or biaxial material. In a uniaxial material, one ray behaves according to the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. As explained above, the other polarization can deviate from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus became known as the extraordinary ray . The terms \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved. A material is termed uniaxial when it has a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It also happens to be the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, n α , n β and n γ , along three coordinate axes; in this case two are equal. So if n α = n β corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index is n γ corresponding to the z axis, which is also called the optic axis in this case. Materials in which all three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and the origin of this term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principal directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial , with the two \"axes\" in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.",

Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined by one of the 32 possible crystallographic point groups ), crystals in that group may be forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or neither in which case it is a biaxial crystal. The crystal structures permitting uniaxial and biaxial birefringence are noted in the two tables, below, listing the two or three principal refractive indices (at wavelength 590 nm) of some better-known crystals. [9] In addition to induced birefringence while under stress, many plastics obtain permanent birefringence during manufacture due to stresses which are \"frozen in\" due to mechanical forces present when the plastic is molded or extruded. [10] For example, ordinary cellophane is birefringent. Polarizers are routinely used to detect stress,  either applied or frozen-in, in plastics such as polystyrene and polycarbonate . Cotton fiber is birefringent because of high levels of cellulosic material in the fibre's secondary cell wall which is directionally aligned with the cotton fibers. Polarized light microscopy is commonly used in biological tissue, as many biological materials are linearly or circularly birefringent. Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon, bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is birefringent and commonly studied with polarized light microscopy. [11] Some proteins are also birefringent, exhibiting form birefringence. [12] Inevitable manufacturing imperfections in optical fiber leads to birefringence, which is one cause of pulse broadening in fiber-optic communications . Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), or due to unequal lateral stress applied to the optical fibre. Birefringence is intentionally introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) in order to produce polarization-maintaining optical fibers . Birefringence can be induced (or corrected) in optical fibers through bending them which causes anisotropy in form and stress given the axis around which it is bent and radius of curvature. In addition to anisotropy in the electric polarizability that we have been discussing, anisotropy in the magnetic permeability could be a source of birefringence. At optical frequencies, there is no measurable magnetic polarizability ( μ = μ 0 ) of natural materials, so this is not an actual source of birefringence.",

        "text": "Birefringence is utilized in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes is a pair of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the x direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer ) oriented in the y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. Areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the x -polarized light into the y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence. For instance, needle aspiration of fluid from a gouty joint will reveal negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals . Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence. [19] Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel to that of a red compensator filter, [20] or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison. The birefringence of tissue inside a living human thigh was measured using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography at 1310 nm and a single mode fiber in a needle. Skeletal muscle birefringence was Δn = 1.79 × 10 −3 ± 0.18×10 −3 , adipose Δn = 0.07 × 10 −3 ± 0.50 × 10 −3 , superficial aponeurosis Δn = 5.08 × 10 −3 ± 0.73 × 10 −3 and interstitial tissue Δn = 0.65 × 10 −3 ±0.39 × 10 −3 . [21] These measurements may be important for the development of a less invasive method to diagnose Duchenne muscular dystrophy . Birefringence can be observed in amyloid plaques such as are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red. Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take on a beta-pleated sheet conformation . Congo red dye intercalates between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence. In ophthalmology , binocular retinal birefringence screening of the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia . [22] In healthy subjects, the maximum retardation induced by the Henle fiber layer is approximately 22 degrees at 840 nm. [23] Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry uses the birefringence of the optic nerve fiber layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma . Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography measurements obtained from healthy human subjects have demonstrated a change in birefringence of the retinal nerve fiber layer as a function of location around the optic nerve head. [24] The same technology was recently applied in the living human retina to quantify the polarization properties of vessel walls near the optic nerve. [25] While retinal vessel walls become thicker and less birefringent in patients who suffer from hypertension, [26] hinting at a decrease in vessel wall condition, the vessel walls of diabetic patients do not experience a change in thickness, but do see an increase in birefringence, [27] presumably due to fibrosis or inflammation. Birefringence characteristics in sperm heads allow the selection of spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection . [28] Likewise, zona imaging uses birefringence on oocytes to select the ones with highest chances of successful pregnancy. [29] Birefringence of particles biopsied from pulmonary nodules indicates silicosis . Dermatologists use dermatoscopes to view skin lesions. Dermoscopes use polarized light, allowing the user to view crystalline structures corresponding to dermal collagen in the skin. These structures may appear as shiny white lines or rosette shapes and are only visible under polarized dermoscopy .",

        "text": "In an isotropic medium (including free space) the so-called electric displacement ( D ) is just proportional to the electric field ( E ) according to D = ɛ E where the material's permittivity ε is just a scalar (and equal to n 2 ε 0 where n is the index of refraction ). In an anisotropic material exhibiting birefringence, the relationship between D and E must now be described using a tensor equation: where ε is now a 3 × 3 permittivity tensor. We assume linearity and no magnetic permeability in the medium: μ = μ 0 . The electric field of a plane wave of angular frequency ω can be written in the general form: where r is the position vector, t is time, and E 0 is a vector describing the electric field at r = 0 , t = 0 . Then we shall find the possible wave vectors k . By combining Maxwell's equations for ∇ × E and ∇ × H , we can eliminate H = 1 / μ 0 B to obtain: With no free charges, Maxwell's equation for the divergence of D vanishes: We can apply the vector identity ∇ × (∇ × A ) = ∇(∇ ⋅ A ) − ∇ 2 A to the left hand side of eq. 3a , and use the spatial dependence in which each differentiation in x (for instance) results in multiplication by ik x to find: The right hand side of eq. 3a can be expressed in terms of E through application of the permittivity tensor ε and noting that differentiation in time results in multiplication by − iω , eq. 3a then becomes: Applying the differentiation rule to eq. 3b we find: Eq. 4b indicates that D is orthogonal to the direction of the wavevector k , even though that is no longer generally true for E as would be the case in an isotropic medium. Eq. 4b will not be needed for the further steps in the following derivation. Finding the allowed values of k for a given ω is easiest done by using Cartesian coordinates with the x , y and z axes chosen in the directions of the symmetry axes of the crystal (or simply choosing z in the direction of the optic axis of a uniaxial crystal), resulting in a diagonal matrix for the permittivity tensor ε : where the diagonal values are squares of the refractive indices for polarizations along the three principal axes x , y and z . With ε in this form, and substituting in the speed of light c using c 2 = 1 / μ 0 ε 0 , the x component of the vector equation eq. 4a becomes where E x , E y , E z are the components of E (at any given position in space and time) and k x , k y , k z are the components of k . Rearranging, we can write (and similarly for the y and z components of eq. 4a ) This is a set of linear equations in E x , E y , E z , so it can have a nontrivial solution (that is, one other than E = 0 ) as long as the following determinant is zero: Evaluating the determinant of eq. 6 , and rearranging the terms according to the powers of ω 2 c 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\omega ^{2}}{c^{2}}}} , the constant terms cancel. After eliminating the common factor ω 2 c 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\omega ^{2}}{c^{2}}}} from the remaining terms, we obtain In the case of a uniaxial material, choosing the optic axis to be in the z direction so that n x = n y = n o and n z = n e , this expression can be factored into Setting either of the factors in eq. 8 to zero will define an ellipsoidal surface [note 1] in the space of wavevectors k that are allowed for a given ω . The first factor being zero defines a sphere; this is the solution for so-called ordinary rays, in which the effective refractive index is exactly n o regardless of the direction of k . The second defines a spheroid symmetric about the z axis. This solution corresponds to the so-called extraordinary rays in which the effective refractive index is in between n o and n e , depending on the direction of k . Therefore, for any arbitrary direction of propagation (other than in the direction of the optic axis), two distinct wavevectors k are allowed corresponding to the polarizations of the ordinary and extraordinary rays. For a biaxial material a similar but more complicated condition on the two waves can be described; [31] the locus of allowed k vectors (the wavevector surface ) is a 4th-degree two-sheeted surface, so that in a given direction there are generally two permitted k vectors (and their opposites). [32] By inspection one can see that eq. 6 is generally satisfied for two positive values of ω . Or, for a specified optical frequency ω and direction normal to the wavefronts k / | k | , it is satisfied for two wavenumbers (or propagation constants) | k | (and thus effective refractive indices) corresponding to the propagation of two linear polarizations in that direction. When those two propagation constants are equal then the effective refractive index is independent of polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a uniaxial crystal, this is the optic axis, the ± z direction according to the above construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), n x , n y and n z are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions, where the two sheets of the wave-vector surface touch; [32] these directions are not at all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes ( x , y , z according to the above convention). Historically that accounts for the use of the term \"biaxial\" for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered \"axes\") was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically. These two special directions are generally not of particular interest; biaxial crystals are rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three axes of symmetry. A general state of polarization launched into the medium can always be decomposed into two waves, one in each of those two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers | k | . Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. With a waveplate, there is no spatial displacement between the two rays as their k vectors are still in the same direction. That is true when each of the two polarizations is either normal  to the optic axis (the ordinary ray) or parallel to it (the extraordinary ray). In the more general case, there is a difference not only in the magnitude but the direction of the two rays. For instance, the photograph through a calcite crystal (top of page) shows a shifted image in the two polarizations; this is due to the optic axis being neither parallel nor normal to the crystal surface. And even when the optic axis is parallel to the surface, this will occur for waves launched at non-normal incidence (as depicted in the explanatory figure). In these cases the two k vectors can be found by solving eq. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface, must all be identical. For a uniaxial crystal it will be found that there is not a spatial shift for the ordinary ray (hence its name) which will refract as if the material were non-birefringent with an index the same as the two axes which are not the optic axis. For a biaxial crystal neither ray is deemed \"ordinary\" nor would generally be refracted according to a refractive index equal to one of the principal axes.",

They can be summarised as follows: When a ray of light hits the boundary between two transparent materials, it is divided into a reflected and a refracted ray. The laws of reflection and refraction can be derived from Fermat's principle which states that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.

        "section": "Reflections",
        "text": "Reflections can be divided into two types: specular reflection and diffuse reflection . Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for the production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual ( real ) or extrapolated ( virtual ) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law , which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection. In specular reflection, the direction of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal , a line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. [38] This is known as the Law of Reflection . For flat mirrors , the law of reflection implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are in front of the mirror. The image size is the same as the object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors produce reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came. [39] This is called retroreflection . Mirrors with curved surfaces can be modelled by ray tracing and using the law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces , parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus . Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration . Curved mirrors can form images with a magnification greater than or less than one, and the magnification can be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An upright image formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an inverted image is real and can be projected onto a screen. [40]",

        "section": "Refractions",
        "text": "Refraction occurs when light travels through an area of space that has a changing index of refraction; this principle allows for lenses and the focusing of light. The simplest case of refraction occurs when there is an interface between a uniform medium with index of refraction n 1 and another medium with index of refraction n 2 . In such situations, Snell's Law describes the resulting deflection of the light ray: n 1 sin ⁡ θ 1 = n 2 sin ⁡ θ 2 {\\displaystyle n_{1}\\sin \\theta _{1}=n_{2}\\sin \\theta _{2}} where θ 1 and θ 2 are the angles between the normal (to the interface) and the incident and refracted waves, respectively. [38] The index of refraction of a medium is related to the speed, v , of light in that medium by n = c / v , {\\displaystyle n=c/v,} where c is the speed of light in vacuum . Snell's Law can be used to predict the deflection of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of the media are known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. In most materials, the index of refraction varies with the frequency of the light, known as dispersion . Taking this into account, Snell's Law can be used to predict how a prism will disperse light into a spectrum. [41] The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton. Some media have an index of refraction which varies gradually with position and, therefore, light rays in the medium are curved. This effect is  responsible for mirages seen on hot days: a change in index of refraction air with height causes light rays to bend, creating the appearance of specular reflections in the distance (as if on the surface of a pool of water). Optical materials with varying indexes of refraction are called gradient-index (GRIN) materials. Such materials are used to make gradient-index optics . [42] For light rays travelling from a material with a high index of refraction to a material with a low index of refraction, Snell's law predicts that there is no θ 2 when θ 1 is large. In this case, no transmission occurs; all the light is reflected. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection and allows for fibre optics technology. As light travels down an optical fibre, it undergoes total internal reflection allowing for essentially no light to be lost over the length of the cable. [43]",

        "text": "A device that produces converging or diverging light rays due to refraction is known as a lens . Lenses are characterized by their focal length : a converging lens has positive focal length, while a diverging lens has negative focal length. Smaller focal length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The focal length of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation . [44] Ray tracing can be used to show how images are formed by a lens. For a thin lens in air, the location of the image is given by the simple equation 1 S 1 + 1 S 2 = 1 f , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{S_{1}}}+{\\frac {1}{S_{2}}}={\\frac {1}{f}},} where S 1 is the distance from the object to the lens, θ 2 is the distance from the lens to the image, and f is the focal length of the lens. In the sign convention used here, the object and image distances are positive if the object and image are on opposite sides of the lens. [45] Incoming parallel rays are focused by a converging lens onto a spot one focal length from the lens, on the far side of the lens. This is called the rear focal point of the lens. Rays from an object at a finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance; the closer the object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens. With diverging lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the lens, in such a way that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at a finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side of the lens as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real. [46] Lenses suffer from aberrations that distort images. Monochromatic aberrations occur because the geometry of the lens does not perfectly direct rays from each object point to a single point on the image, while chromatic aberration occurs because the index of refraction of the lens varies with the wavelength of the light.

[53] This interaction of waves to produce a resulting pattern is generally termed \"interference\" and can result in a variety of outcomes. If two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are in phase , both the wave crests and wave troughs align. This results in constructive interference and an increase in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a brightening of the waveform in that location. Alternatively, if the two waves of the same wavelength and frequency are out of phase, then the wave crests will align with wave troughs and vice versa. This results in destructive interference and a decrease in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a dimming of the waveform at that location. See below for an illustration of this effect. [54] Since the Huygens–Fresnel principle states that every point of a wavefront is associated with the production of a new disturbance, it is possible for a wavefront to interfere with itself constructively or destructively at different locations producing bright and dark fringes in regular and predictable patterns. [55] Interferometry is the science of measuring these patterns, usually as a means of making precise determinations of distances or angular resolutions . [56] The Michelson interferometer was a famous instrument which used interference effects to accurately measure the speed of light. [57] The appearance of thin films and coatings is directly affected by interference effects. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, and can be used to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with a thickness of one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave from the top of the film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550 nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength. Constructive interference in thin films can create a strong reflection of light in a range of wavelengths, which can be narrow or broad depending on the design of the coating. These films are used to make dielectric mirrors , interference filters , heat reflectors , and filters for colour separation in colour television cameras. This interference effect is also what causes the colourful rainbow patterns seen in oil slicks. [58]",

        "section": "Diffraction and optical resolution",
        "text": "Diffraction is the process by which light interference is most commonly observed. The effect was first described in 1665 by Francesco Maria Grimaldi , who also coined the term from the Latin diffringere ' to break into pieces ' . [59] [60] Later that century, Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton also described phenomena now known to be diffraction in Newton's rings [61] while James Gregory recorded his observations of diffraction patterns from bird feathers. [62] The first physical optics model of diffraction that relied on the Huygens–Fresnel principle was developed in 1803 by Thomas Young in his interference experiments with the interference patterns of two closely spaced slits. Young showed that his results could only be explained if the two slits acted as two unique sources of waves rather than corpuscles. [63] In 1815 and 1818, Augustin-Jean Fresnel firmly established the mathematics of how wave interference can account for diffraction. [64] The simplest physical models of diffraction use equations that describe the angular separation of light and dark fringes due to light of a particular wavelength ( λ ). In general, the equation takes the form m λ = d sin ⁡ θ {\\displaystyle m\\lambda =d\\sin \\theta } where d is the separation between two wavefront sources (in the case of Young's experiments, it was two slits ), θ is the angular separation between the central fringe and the m -th order fringe, where the central maximum is m = 0 . [65] This equation is modified slightly to take into account a variety of situations such as diffraction through a single gap, diffraction through multiple slits, or diffraction through a diffraction grating that contains a large number of slits at equal spacing. [66] More complicated models of diffraction require working with the mathematics of Fresnel or Fraunhofer diffraction . [67] X-ray diffraction makes use of the fact that atoms in a crystal have regular spacing at distances that are on the order of one angstrom . To see diffraction patterns, x-rays with similar wavelengths to that spacing are passed through the crystal. Since crystals are three-dimensional objects rather than two-dimensional gratings, the associated diffraction pattern varies in two directions according to Bragg reflection , with the associated bright spots occurring in unique patterns and d being twice the spacing between atoms. [68] Diffraction effects limit the ability of an optical detector to optically resolve separate light sources. In general, light that is passing through an aperture will experience diffraction and the best images that can be created (as described in diffraction-limited optics ) appear as a central spot with surrounding bright rings, separated by dark nulls; this pattern is known as an Airy pattern , and the central bright lobe as an Airy disk . [69] The size of such a disk is given by sin ⁡ θ = 1.22 λ D {\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta =1.22{\\frac {\\lambda }{D}}} where θ is the angular resolution, λ is the wavelength of the light, and D is the diameter of the lens aperture. If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the Airy disk angular radius, then the two points cannot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary \" Rayleigh criterion \" that two points whose angular separation is equal to the Airy disk radius (measured to first null, that is, to the first place where no light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the finer the resolution. [70] Interferometry , with its ability to mimic extremely large baseline apertures, allows for the greatest angular resolution possible. [56] For astronomical imaging, the atmosphere prevents optimal resolution from being achieved in the visible spectrum due to the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which cause stars to twinkle . Astronomers refer to this effect as the quality of astronomical seeing . Techniques known as adaptive optics have been used to eliminate the atmospheric disruption of images and achieve results that approach the diffraction limit. [71]",

        "section": "Dispersion and scattering",
        "text": "Refractive processes take place in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering , wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material. [72] Dispersion occurs when different frequencies of light have different phase velocities , due either to material properties ( material dispersion ) or to the geometry of an optical waveguide ( waveguide dispersion ). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease in index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent materials. This is called \"normal dispersion\". It occurs in all dielectric materials , in wavelength ranges where the material does not absorb light. [73] In wavelength ranges where a medium has significant absorption, the index of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called \"anomalous dispersion\". [73] The separation of colours by a prism is an example of normal dispersion. At the surfaces of the prism, Snell's law predicts that light incident at an angle θ to the normal will be refracted at an angle arcsin(sin ( θ ) / n ) . Thus, blue light, with its higher refractive index, is bent more strongly than red light, resulting in the well-known rainbow pattern. [41] Material dispersion is often characterised by the Abbe number , which gives a simple measure of dispersion based on the index of refraction at three specific wavelengths. Waveguide dispersion is dependent on the propagation constant . [74] Both kinds of dispersion cause changes in the group characteristics of the wave, the features of the wave packet that change with the same frequency as the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. \"Group velocity dispersion\" manifests as a spreading-out of the signal \"envelope\" of the radiation and can be quantified with a group dispersion delay parameter: D = 1 v g 2 d v g d λ {\\displaystyle D={\\frac {1}{v_{\\mathrm {g} }^{2}}}{\\frac {dv_{\\mathrm {g} }}{d\\lambda }}} where v g is the group velocity. [75] For a uniform medium, the group velocity is v g = c ( n − λ d n d λ ) − 1 {\\displaystyle v_{\\mathrm {g} }=c\\left(n-\\lambda {\\frac {dn}{d\\lambda }}\\right)^{-1}} where n is the index of refraction and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. [76] This gives a simpler form for the dispersion delay parameter: D = − λ c d 2 n d λ 2 . {\\displaystyle D=-{\\frac {\\lambda }{c}}\\,{\\frac {d^{2}n}{d\\lambda ^{2}}}.} If D is less than zero, the medium is said to have positive dispersion or normal dispersion. If D is greater than zero, the medium has negative dispersion . If a light pulse is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped , or up-chirped , increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high-frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes negatively chirped , or down-chirped , decreasing in frequency with time. [77] The result of group velocity dispersion, whether negative or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fibres , since if dispersion is too high, a group of pulses representing information will each spread in time and merge, making it impossible to extract the signal.

        "section": "Changing polarisation",
        "text": "Media that have different indexes of refraction for different polarisation modes are called birefringent . [84] Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates /retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation / optical rotation (circular modes). [85] If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, this is the case with macroscopic crystals of calcite , which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarisation, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarisation state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism , often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy , such properties, known as pleochroism , are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarisation microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress , a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity . [86] Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarisation of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarisation rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission. [87] Media that reduce the amplitude of certain polarisation modes are called dichroic , with devices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode known as polarising filters or simply \" polarisers \". Malus' law, which is named after Étienne-Louis Malus , says that when a perfect polariser is placed in a linear polarised beam of light, the intensity, I , of the light that passes through is given by I = I 0 cos 2 ⁡ θ i , {\\displaystyle I=I_{0}\\cos ^{2}\\theta _{\\mathrm {i} },} where I 0 is the initial intensity, and θ i is the angle between the light's initial polarisation direction and the axis of the polariser. [88] A beam of unpolarised light can be thought of as containing a uniform mixture of linear polarisations at all possible angles. Since the average value of cos 2 θ is 1/2, the transmission coefficient becomes I I 0 = 1 2 . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {I}{I_{0}}}={\\frac {1}{2}}\\,.} In practice, some light is lost in the polariser and the actual transmission of unpolarised light will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarisers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some birefringent prism types. [89] In addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarisation effects can also occur at the (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations . Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle . [90] When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can produce polarisation in the reflected and transmitted light.",

The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated , in which case the light is said to be unpolarised . If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised . If the polarisation is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarisation , and the parameters of the polarisation ellipse. [79] Light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was this effect that allowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarisation occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere . The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies . This partial polarisation of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarising filters to darken the sky in photographs . Optical polarisation is principally of importance in chemistry due to circular dichroism and optical rotation ( circular birefringence ) exhibited by optically active ( chiral ) molecules . [91]",

The term laser is an acronym for ' Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ' . [95] Laser light is usually spatially coherent , which means that the light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam , or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Because the microwave equivalent of the laser, the maser , was developed first, devices that emit microwave and radio frequencies are usually called masers . [96] The first working laser was demonstrated on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories . [98] When first invented, they were called \"a solution looking for a problem\". [99] Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in the daily lives of the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. [100] The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. [101] These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers . Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery , laser eye surgery , and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems , electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM) , and lidar . Lasers are also used in holograms , bubblegrams , laser light shows , and laser hair removal . [102]",

        "section": "Human eye",
        "text": "The human eye functions by focusing light onto a layer of photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the inner lining of the back of the eye. The focusing is accomplished by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes first through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light then continues through the fluid just behind the cornea—the anterior chamber , then passes through the pupil . The light then passes through the lens , which focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light then passes through the main body of fluid in the eye—the vitreous humour , and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eye, except for where the optic nerve exits; this results in a blind spot . There are two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. [103] Rod cells are sensitive to the intensity of light over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision . Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision . [104] In contrast, cone cells are less sensitive to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus are used in the perception of colour and photopic vision . Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells. [104] Ciliary muscles around the lens allow the eye's focus to be adjusted. This process is known as accommodation . The near point and far point define the nearest and farthest distances from the eye at which an object can be brought into sharp focus. For a person with normal vision, the far point is located at infinity. The near point's location depends on how much the muscles can increase the curvature of the lens, and how inflexible the lens has become with age. Optometrists , ophthalmologists , and opticians usually consider an appropriate near point to be closer than normal reading distance—approximately 25 cm. [103] Defects in vision can be explained using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia . Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects to be focused on different parts of the retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images. [103] All of these conditions can be corrected using corrective lenses . For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea. [105] The optical power of corrective lenses is measured in diopters , a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative focal length corresponding to a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, and one for the angle of orientation of the astigmatism. [105]",

The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusions can be the result of a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create images that are different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects on the eyes and brain of excessive stimulation (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences . [106] Cognitive illusions include some which result from the unconscious misapplication of certain optical principles. For example, the Ames room , Hering , Müller-Lyer , Orbison , Ponzo , Sander , and Wundt illusions all rely on the suggestion of the appearance of distance by using converging and diverging lines, in the same way that parallel light rays (or indeed any set of parallel lines) appear to converge at a vanishing point at infinity in two-dimensionally rendered images with artistic perspective. [107] This suggestion is also responsible for the famous moon illusion where the moon, despite having essentially the same angular size, appears much larger near the horizon than it does at zenith . [108] This illusion so confounded Ptolemy that he incorrectly attributed it to atmospheric refraction when he described it in his treatise, Optics . [8] Another type of optical illusion exploits broken patterns to trick the mind into perceiving symmetries or asymmetries that are not present. Examples include the café wall , Ehrenstein , Fraser spiral , Poggendorff , and Zöllner illusions . Related, but not strictly illusions, are patterns that occur due to the superimposition of periodic structures. For example, transparent tissues with a grid structure produce shapes known as moiré patterns , while the superimposition of periodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines or curves produces line moiré patterns.

        "text": "Single lenses have a variety of applications including photographic lenses , corrective lenses, and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used in parabolic reflectors and rear-view mirrors . Combining a number of mirrors, prisms, and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply two plane mirrors aligned to allow for viewing around obstructions. The most famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by the Dutch in the late 16th century. [110] Microscopes were first developed with just two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece . The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This has the effect of producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. [111] A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope , looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans. [112] The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes, were also developed with a single objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses an image of a distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather the collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification. [113] Since crafting large lenses is much more difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes , that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead. [114]",

        "text": "The optics of photography involves both lenses and the medium in which the electromagnetic radiation is recorded, whether it be a plate , film , or charge-coupled device. Photographers must consider the reciprocity of the camera and the shot which is summarized by the relation In other words, the smaller the aperture (giving greater depth of focus), the less light coming in, so the length of time has to be increased (leading to possible blurriness if motion occurs). An example of the use of the law of reciprocity is the Sunny 16 rule which gives a rough estimate for the settings needed to estimate the proper exposure in daylight. [116] A camera's aperture is measured by a unitless number called the f-number or f-stop, f / #, often notated as N {\\displaystyle N} , and given by where f {\\displaystyle f} is the focal length, and D {\\displaystyle D} is the diameter of the entrance pupil. By convention, \" f / #\" is treated as a single symbol, and specific values of f / # are written by replacing the number sign with the value. The two ways to increase the f-stop are to either decrease the diameter of the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length (in the case of a zoom lens , this can be done by simply adjusting the lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposure times. [117] The field of view that the lens will provide changes with the focal length of the lens. There are three basic classifications based on the relationship to the diagonal size of the film or sensor size of the camera to the focal length of the lens: [118] Modern zoom lenses may have some or all of these attributes. The absolute value for the exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the film speed , or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency ). [123] Early photography used media that had very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had to be long even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital cameras. [124] Other results from physical and geometrical optics apply to camera optics. For example, the maximum resolution capability of a particular camera set-up is determined by the diffraction limit associated with the pupil size and given, roughly, by the Rayleigh criterion.

        "text": "The unique optical properties of the atmosphere cause a wide range of spectacular optical phenomena. The blue colour of the sky is a direct result of Rayleigh scattering which redirects higher frequency (blue) sunlight back into the field of view of the observer. Because blue light is scattered more easily than red light, the sun takes on a reddish hue when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as during a sunrise or sunset . Additional particulate matter in the sky can scatter different colours at different angles creating colourful glowing skies at dusk and dawn. Scattering off of ice crystals and other particles in the atmosphere are responsible for halos , afterglows , coronas , rays of sunlight , and sun dogs . The variation in these kinds of phenomena is due to different particle sizes and geometries. [126] Mirages are optical phenomena in which light rays are bent due to thermal variations in the refraction index of air, producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects. Other dramatic optical phenomena associated with this include the Novaya Zemlya effect where the sun appears to rise earlier than predicted with a distorted shape. A spectacular form of refraction occurs with a temperature inversion called the Fata Morgana where objects on the horizon or even beyond the horizon, such as islands, cliffs, ships or icebergs, appear elongated and elevated, like \"fairy tale castles\". [127] Rainbows are the result of a combination of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops. A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with the sun 180° away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon. [128]",

        "text": "A waveplate works by shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with the orientation of the cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis , with index of refraction n o , and the extraordinary axis , with index of refraction n e . The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, the polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed v o = c / n o , while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed v e = c / n e . This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When n e < n o , as in calcite , the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis . For n e > n o the situation is reversed. Depending on the thickness of the crystal, light with polarization components along both axes will emerge in a different polarization state. The waveplate is characterized by the amount of relative phase, Γ, that it imparts on the two components, which is related to the birefringence Δ n and the thickness L of the crystal by the formula where λ 0 is the vacuum wavelength of the light. Waveplates in general, as well as polarizers , can be described using the Jones matrix formalism, which uses a vector to represent the polarization state of light and a matrix to represent the linear transformation of a waveplate or polarizer. Although the birefringence Δ n may vary slightly due to dispersion , this is negligible compared to the variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ 0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured to work for a particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate . For a single waveplate changing the wavelength of the light introduces a linear error in the phase. Tilt of the waveplate enters via a factor of 1/cos θ (where θ is the angle of tilt) into the path length and thus only quadratically into the phase. For the extraordinary polarization the tilt also changes the refractive index to the ordinary via a factor of cos θ, so combined with the path length, the phase shift for the extraordinary light due to tilt is zero. A polarization-independent phase shift of zero order needs a plate with thickness of one wavelength.\nFor calcite the refractive index changes in the first decimal place, so that a true zero order plate is ten times as thick as one wavelength.\nFor quartz and magnesium fluoride the refractive index changes in the second decimal place and true zero order plates are common for wavelengths above 1 μm.",

For linearly polarized light, this is equivalent to saying that the effect of the half-wave plate is to rotate the polarization vector through an angle 2θ; however, for elliptically polarized light the half-wave plate also has the effect of inverting the light's handedness .

If the input polarization is parallel to the fast or slow axis, then there is no polarization of the other axis, so the output polarization is the same as the input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the fast axis.
