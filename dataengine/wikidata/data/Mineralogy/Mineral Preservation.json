        "text": "Amber is heterogeneous in composition, but consists of several resinous bodies [ clarify ] more or less soluble in alcohol , ether and chloroform , associated with an insoluble bituminous substance. Amber is a macromolecule formed by free radical polymerization [23] of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid , communol , and biformene . [24] [25] These labdanes are diterpenes (C 20 H 32 ) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization . As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization . [26] [23] Most amber has a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5 on the Mohs scale , a refractive index of 1.5–1.6, a specific gravity between 1.06 and 1.10, and a melting point of 250–300 °C. [27] Heated above 200 °C (392 °F), amber decomposes, yielding an oil of amber , and leaves a black residue which is known as \"amber colophony\", or \"amber pitch\"; when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms \"amber varnish\" or \"amber lac\". [24] Molecular polymerization, [23] resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal . Sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber. [28] For this to happen, the resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes. Exposure to sunlight, rain, microorganisms, and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin. For the resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them. [29] Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the Baltic ambers and another that resembles the Agathis group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus Hymenaea , [30] while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from plants of the family Sciadopityaceae that once lived in north Europe. [31] The abnormal development of resin in living trees ( succinosis ) can result in the formation of amber. [32] Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin has dropped onto the ground, so the material may be useless except for varnish-making. Such impure amber is called firniss . [33] Such inclusion of other substances can cause the amber to have an unexpected color. Pyrites may give a bluish color. Bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin. [34] However, so-called black amber is really a kind of jet . [ citation needed ] In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution X-rays . [35]",

        "text": "Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger. Historically, the coast west of Königsberg in Prussia was the world's leading source of amber. The first mentions of amber deposits there date back to the 12th century. [36] Juodkrantė in Lithuania was established in the mid. 19 century as a mining town of amber. About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which was transferred to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of the USSR in 1946, becoming the Kaliningrad Oblast . [37] Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber. [34] Dominican amber is mined through bell pitting , which is dangerous because of the risk of tunnel collapse. [38] An important source of amber is Kachin State in northern Myanmar , which has been a major source of amber in China for at least 1,800 years. Contemporary mining of this deposit has attracted attention for unsafe working conditions and its role in funding internal conflict in the country . [39] Amber from the Rivne Oblast of Ukraine, referred to as Rivne amber , is mined illegally by organised crime groups, who deforest the surrounding areas and pump water into the sediments to extract the amber, causing severe environmental deterioration.

        "text": "Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color \"amber\", amber can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as \"cherry amber\"), green amber, and even blue amber , which is rare and highly sought after. [42] Yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees, and despite the name it can be translucent, yellow, orange, or brown colored. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah \"straw\" plus rubay \"attract, snatch\", referring to its electrical properties [13] ), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for electricity , كهرباء kahrabā ' ), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry. Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as \"bony amber\". [43] Although all Dominican amber is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about 100 kg (220 lb) is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive. [44] Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites , just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. [34] It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.",

        "text": "The oldest amber recovered dates to the late Carboniferous period ( 320 million years ago ). [1] [51] Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers – it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants; however, the first flowering plants appeared in the Early Cretaceous, about 200 million years after the oldest amber know to date, and they were not common until the Late Cretaceous . Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the Early Cretaceous , [1] when it is found in association with insects. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Late Triassic (late Carnian c. 230 Ma) of Italy, where four microscopic (0.2–0.1 mm) mites, Triasacarus , Ampezzoa , Minyacarus and Cheirolepidoptus , and a poorly preserved nematoceran fly were found in millimetre-sized droplets of amber. [52] [53] The oldest amber with significant numbers of arthropod inclusions comes from Lebanon. This amber, referred to as Lebanese amber , is roughly 125–135 million years old, is considered of high scientific value, providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled ecosystems. [54] In Lebanon, more than 450 outcrops of Lower Cretaceous amber were discovered by Dany Azar, [55] a Lebanese paleontologist and entomologist. Among these outcrops, 20 have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods. Even older Jurassic amber has been found recently in Lebanon as well. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan including the oldest zorapterans , clerid beetles , umenocoleid roaches , and achiliid planthoppers . [54] Burmese amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar is the only commercially exploited Cretaceous amber. Uranium–lead dating of zircon crystals associated with the deposit have given an estimated depositional age of approximately 99 million years ago. Over 1,300 species have been described from the amber, with over 300 in 2019 alone. Baltic amber is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand, known as blue earth , occurring in Upper Eocene strata of Sambia in Prussia. [24] It appears to have been partly derived from older Eocene deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as glacial drift . Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of eastern Asia and the southern part of North America. Heinrich Göppert named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests Pinites succiniter , but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called Pinus succinifera . It is improbable that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora. [34]",

[1] Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted. Insects , spiders and even their webs, annelids , frogs , [57] crustaceans , bacteria and amoebae , [58] marine microfossils, [59] wood, flowers and fruit, hair, feathers [3] and other small organisms have been recovered in Cretaceous ambers (deposited c. 130 million years ago ). [1] There is even an ammonite Puzosia (Bhimaites) and marine gastropods found in Burmese amber . [60] The preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in Michael Crichton 's 1990 novel Jurassic Park and the 1993 movie adaptation by Steven Spielberg . [61] In the story, scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of dinosaurs from prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber, from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs. Scientifically this is as yet impossible, since no amber with fossilized mosquitoes has ever yielded preserved blood. [62] Amber is, however, conducive to preserving DNA , since it dehydrates and thus stabilizes organisms trapped inside. One projection in 1999 estimated that DNA trapped in amber could last up to 100 million years, far beyond most estimates of around 1 million years in the most ideal conditions, [63] although a later 2013 study was unable to extract DNA from insects trapped in much more recent Holocene copal . [64] In 1938, 12-year-old David Attenborough (brother of Richard who played John Hammond in Jurassic Park ) was given a piece of amber containing prehistoric creatures from his adoptive sister; it would be the focus of his 2004 BBC documentary The Amber Time Machine .

[13] For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by scavengers or decomposition.

[39] Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years. [40] The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA , protein , or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology . Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering can alter the state of preservation, and small subfossils can also be ingested by living organisms . Subfossil remains that date from the Mesozoic are exceptionally rare, are usually in an advanced state of decay, and are consequently much disputed. [41] The vast bulk of subfossil material comes from Quaternary sediments, including many subfossilized chironomid head capsules, ostracod carapaces , diatoms , and foraminifera . For remains such as molluscan seashells , which frequently do not change their chemical composition over geological time, and may occasionally even retain such features as the original color markings for millions of years, the label 'subfossil' is applied to shells that are understood to be thousands of years old, but are of Holocene age, and therefore are not old enough to be from the Pleistocene epoch.

        "section": "Stromatolites",
        "text": "Stromatolites are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilms of microorganisms , especially cyanobacteria . [54] Stromatolites provide some of the most ancient fossil records of life on Earth, dating back more than 3.5 billion years ago. [55] Stromatolites were much more abundant in Precambrian times. While older, Archean fossil remains are presumed to be colonies of cyanobacteria , younger (that is, Proterozoic ) fossils may be primordial forms of the eukaryote chlorophytes (that is, green algae ). One genus of stromatolite very common in the geologic record is Collenia . The earliest stromatolite of confirmed microbial origin dates to 2.724 billion years ago. [56] A 2009 discovery provides strong evidence of microbial stromatolites extending as far back as 3.45 billion years ago. [57] [58] Stromatolites are a major constituent of the fossil record for life's first 3.5 billion years, peaking about 1.25 billion years ago. [57] They subsequently declined in abundance and diversity, [59] which by the start of the Cambrian had fallen to 20% of their peak. The most widely supported explanation is that stromatolite builders fell victims to grazing creatures (the Cambrian substrate revolution ), implying that sufficiently complex organisms were common over 1 billion years ago. [60] [61] [62] The connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance is well documented in the younger Ordovician evolutionary radiation ; stromatolite abundance also increased after the end-Ordovician and end-Permian extinctions decimated marine animals, falling back to earlier levels as marine animals recovered. [63] Fluctuations in metazoan population and diversity may not have been the only factor in the reduction in stromatolite abundance. Factors such as the chemistry of the environment may have been responsible for changes. [64] While prokaryotic cyanobacteria themselves reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the evolutionary development of more complex eukaryotic organisms. Cyanobacteria (as well as extremophile Gammaproteobacteria ) are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval Earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis . Cyanobacteria use water , carbon dioxide and sunlight to create their food. A layer of mucus often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of limestone . These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed oncolites are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the fossil record . Thrombolites are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria common in the fossil record and in modern sediments. [56] The Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of southwestern Namibia provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the Proterozoic period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.

        "text": "Petrified wood forms when woody stems of plants are buried in wet sediments saturated with dissolved minerals. The lack of oxygen slows decay of the wood, allowing minerals to replace cell walls and to fill void spaces in the wood. [2] [1] Wood is composed mostly of holocellulose ( cellulose and hemicellulose ) and lignin . Together, these substances make up 95% of the dry composition of wood. Almost half of this is cellulose, which gives wood much of its strength. Cellulose is composed of long chains of polymerized glucose arranged into microfibrils that reinforce the cell walls in the wood. Hemicellulose, a branched polymer of various simple sugars , makes up the majority of the remaining composition of hardwood while lignin, which is a polymer of phenylpropanes , is more abundant in softwood . The hemicellulose and lignin encrust and reinforce the cellulose microfibrils. [2] Dead wood is normally rapidly decomposed by microorganisms, beginning with the holocellulose. The lignin is hydrophobic (water-repelling) and much slower to decay. The rate of decay is affected by temperature and moisture content, but exclusion of oxygen is the most important factor preserving wood tissue: Organisms that decompose lignin must have oxygen for their life processes. As a result, fossil wood older than Eocene (about 56 million years old or older) has lost almost all its holocellulose, and only lignin remains. In addition to microbial decomposition, wood buried in an alkaline environment is rapidly broken down by inorganic reactions with the alkali. [2] Wood is preserved from decomposition by rapid entombment in mud, particularly mud formed from volcanic ash. [7] The wood is then mineralized to transform it to stone. Non-mineralized wood has been recovered from Paleozoic formations, particularly Callixylon from Berea Sandstone , but this is very unusual. The petrified wood is later exposed by erosion of surrounding sediments. Non-mineralized fossil wood is rapidly destroyed when exposed by erosion, but petrified wood is quite durable. [2] Some 40 minerals have been identified in petrified wood, but silica minerals are by far the most important. Calcite and pyrite are much less common, and others are quite rare. Silica binds to the cellulose in cell walls via hydrogen bonding and forms a kind of template. Additional silica then replaces the cellulose as it decomposes, so that cell walls are often preserved in great detail. [2] Thus silicification begins within the cell walls, and the spaces within and between cells are filled with silica more gradually. [1] [8] [9] Over time, almost all the original organic material is lost; only around 10% remains in the petrified wood. [2] [1] The remaining material is nearly pure silica, with only iron, aluminum, and alkali and alkaline earth elements present in more than trace amounts. Iron, calcium, aluminum are the most common, and one or more of these elements may make up more than 1% of the composition. [2] Just what form the silica initially takes is still a topic of research. There is evidence of initial deposition as opal , which then recrystallizes to quartz over long time periods. [2] [9] On the other hand, there is some evidence that silica is deposited directly as quartz. [8] Wood can become silicified very rapidly in silica-rich hot springs. [10] While wood petrified in this setting is only a minor part of the geologic record, [2] hot spring deposits are important to paleontologists because such deposits sometimes preserve more delicate plant parts in exquisite detail. These Lagerstätte deposits include the Paleozoic Rhynie Chert and East Kirkton Limestone beds, which record early stages in the evolution of land plants. [11] Most of the color in petrified wood comes from trace metals. Of these, iron is the most important, and it can produce a range of hues depending on its oxidation state . Chromium produces bright green petrified wood. Variations in color likely reflect different episodes of mineralization. In some cases, variations may come from chromatographic separation of trace metals. [12] Wood can also be petrified by calcite , as occurs in concretions in coal beds. Wood petrified by calcite tends to retain more of its original organic material. Petrification begins with deposition of goethite in the cell walls, followed by deposition of calcite in the void spaces. [13] Carbonized wood is resistant to silicification and is usually petrified by other minerals. [1] Wood petrified by minerals other than silica minerals tends to accumulate heavy metals, such as uranium , selenium , and germanium , with uranium most common in wood high in lignin and germanium most common in wood preserved in coal beds. Boron , zinc , and phosphorus are anomalously low in fossil wood, suggesting they are leached away or scavenged by microorganisms. [2] Less commonly, the replacement minerals in petrified wood are chalcocite or other sulfide minerals . These have been mined as copper ore at locations such as the Nacimiento Mine near Cuba, New Mexico . [14]",

        "text": "A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals [32] or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as limestone or quartzite , are composed primarily of one mineral – calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone, and quartz in the latter case. [33] [34] Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz, alkali feldspar , and plagioclase feldspar . [35] The other minerals in the rock are termed accessory minerals , and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock. Rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; coal is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon. [32] [36] In rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals. The major examples of these are quartz, the feldspars , the micas , the amphiboles , the pyroxenes , the olivines , and calcite; except for the last one, all of these minerals are silicates. [37] Overall, around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting. [38] Commercially valuable minerals and rocks, other than gemstones, metal ores, or mineral fuels, are referred to as industrial minerals . [39] For example, muscovite , a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. [40] Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury; sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc; cassiterite (SnO 2 ), an ore of tin; and colemanite , an ore of boron . Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum , Al 2 O 3 . [41]",

        "section": "Chemistry",
        "text": "The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust . Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: oxygen , silicon , aluminium , iron , magnesium , calcium , sodium and potassium . Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important – oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%. [44] The minerals that form are those that are most stable at the temperature and pressure of formation, within the limits imposed by the bulk chemistry of the parent body. [45] For example, in most igneous rocks, the aluminium and alkali metals (sodium and potassium) that are present are  primarily found in combination with oxygen, silicon, and calcium as feldspar minerals. However, if the rock is unusually rich in alkali metals, there will not be enough aluminium to combine with all the sodium as feldspar, and the excess sodium will form sodic amphiboles such as riebeckite . If the aluminium abundance is unusually high, the excess aluminium will form muscovite or other aluminium-rich minerals. [46] If silicon is deficient, part of the feldspar will be replaced by feldspathoid minerals. [47] Precise predictions of which minerals will be present in a rock of a particular composition formed at a particular temperature and pressure requires complex thermodynamic calculations. However, approximate estimates may be made using relatively simple rules of thumb , such as the CIPW norm , which gives reasonable estimates for volcanic rock formed from dry magma. [48] The chemical composition may vary between end member species of a solid solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium -rich end member albite (NaAlSi 3 O 8 ) to calcium -rich anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase , andesine , labradorite , and bytownite . [49] Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese -rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite . [50] Chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another. [51] Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K + will not substitute for Si 4+ because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si 4+ by Al 3+ , which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si 4+ by Al 3+ to give a base unit of [AlSi 3 O 8 ] − ; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO 2 , giving quartz. [52] The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na + and Ca 2+ ; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si 4+ by Al 3+ . [53] Coordination polyhedra are geometric representations of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si 4+ surrounded by four O 2− . An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where the compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination with oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination numbers because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure, such as in the mantle , many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet , will change to a perovskite structure , where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Other examples are the aluminosilicates kyanite , andalusite , and sillimanite (polymorphs, since they share the formula Al 2 SiO 5 ), which differ by the coordination number of the Al 3+ ; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature. [44] In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si 4+ by Al 3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges. [54] Because the eight most common elements make up over 98% of the Earth's crust, the small quantities of the other elements that are typically present are substituted into the common rock-forming minerals. The distinctive minerals of most elements are quite rare, being found only where these elements have been concentrated by geological processes, such as hydrothermal circulation , to the point where they can no longer be accommodated in common minerals. [55] Changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample. Changes in composition can be caused by processes such as weathering or metasomatism ( hydrothermal alteration ). Changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes tectonic or magmatic movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in thermodynamic conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the rock cycle . An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows. [56] Orthoclase feldspar (KAlSi 3 O 8 ) is a mineral commonly found in granite , a plutonic igneous rock . When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 , a sedimentary mineral, and silicic acid ): Under low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form pyrophyllite (Al 2 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 ): As metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz: Alternatively, a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO 2 polymorphs , such as tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, and coesite at high pressures. [57]",

        "text": "Crystal structure results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral. This crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or ionic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes. Even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped, the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by X-ray diffraction. [13] Minerals are typically described by their symmetry content. Crystals are restricted to 32 point groups , which differ by their symmetry. These groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families. [59] These families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes, and the angles between them; these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups. They are summarized below; a, b, and c represent the axes, and α, β, γ represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g. α is the angle opposite the a-axis, viz. the angle between the b and c axes): [59] The hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal systems – the trigonal , which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a six-fold axis of symmetry. Chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, halite (NaCl), galena (PbS), and periclase (MgO) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar stoichiometry between their different constituent elements. In contrast, polymorphs are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, pyrite and marcasite , both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS 2 ; however, the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic. This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX 2 formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups. [60] Polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content. The aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals – kyanite , andalusite , and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al 2 SiO 5 . Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These differences arise corresponding to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination with oxygen. Silicon, as a general rule, is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like stishovite (SiO 2 , an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). [61] In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as Al [6] Al [6] SiO 5 , to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (Al [6] Al [5] SiO 5 ) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (Al [6] Al [4] SiO 5 ). [62] Differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral. The carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted for by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp 3 hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp 2 hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces , and this discrepancy translates to large macroscopic differences. [63] Twinning is the intergrowth of two or more crystals of a single mineral species. The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. This type of twinning occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings , sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twins through the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, polysynthetic twinning occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale. [64] [65] Crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to describe this property. Common habits include acicular, which describes needlelike crystals as in natrolite , bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper ), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral. [66] [67]",

This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral. The most commonly used scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale, which measures resistance to scratching. Defined by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it. The scale ranges from talc, a phyllosilicate , to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material. The scale is provided below: [68] A mineral's hardness is a function of its structure. Hardness is not necessarily constant for all crystallographic directions; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others. [68] An example of this hardness variability exists in kyanite, which has a Mohs hardness of 5 1 ⁄ 2 parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100] . [69] Other scales include these; [70]",

There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in diamond ; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in talc and apophyllite ; resinous, such as members of the garnet group; silky which is common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform chrysotile . [72] The diaphaneity of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through them. An example of a transparent mineral is muscovite (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. Jadeite and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque. [73] [74] The diaphaneity of a mineral depends on the thickness of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a thin section for petrography ), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in a hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as hematite or pyrite, are opaque even in thin-section. [74]",

        "text": "Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. [75] It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except in the case of incandescence , which does not apply to minerals). [76] Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. [73] [77] Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum . [77] The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of interference of light waves. Examples include labradorite and bornite . In addition to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, asterism , chatoyancy , iridescence , tarnish, and pleochroism . Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, such as in opal , results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry. [78] In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure. [79] Chatoyancy (\"cat's eye\") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum. [78] [79] The streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form, which may or may not be identical to its body colour. [77] The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements [73] or any weathering surface. [77] A common example of this property is illustrated with hematite , which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red [73] to reddish-brown streak. [77] Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements. [73] Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the streak plate instead. [77]",

        "section": "Cleavage, parting, fracture, and tenacity",
        "text": "By definition, minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are \"perfect\", \"good\", \"distinct\", and \"poor\". In particularly transparent minerals, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen as a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed from the side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together. [80] [81] As cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas . Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite , it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage. [80] [81] Minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three directions, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor. [80] [81] Parting, sometimes called \"false cleavage\", is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral, as opposed to systematic weakness. Parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral, whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property. In general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal. The sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g. an increase in pressure), exsolution, or twinning. Minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum. [80] [82] When a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper . [83] Tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture. Whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken, tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking. Minerals can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic. [84]",

        "text": "Specific gravity numerically describes the density of a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m 3 or g/cm 3 . Specific gravity is defined as the density of the mineral divided by the density of water at 4 °C and thus is a dimensionless quantity, identical in all unit systems. [85] It can be measured as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5. [86] High specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite , Fe 2 O 3 , has a specific gravity of 5.26 [87] while galena , PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6, [88] which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity is characteristic of native metals ; for example, kamacite , an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a specific gravity of 7.9, [89] and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.

        "text": "Other properties can be used to diagnose minerals. These are less general, and apply to specific minerals. Dropping dilute acid (often 10% HCl ) onto a mineral aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO 3 ] 2− ) group, which causes the affected area to effervesce , giving off carbon dioxide gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered form. An example of this test is done when distinguishing calcite from dolomite , especially within the rocks ( limestone and dolomite respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce. [91] Zeolite minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel . [92] Magnetism is a very conspicuous property of a few minerals. Among common minerals, magnetite exhibits this property strongly, and magnetism is also present, albeit not as strongly, in pyrrhotite and ilmenite . [91] Some minerals exhibit electrical properties – for example, quartz is piezoelectric – but electrical properties are rarely used as diagnostic criteria for minerals because of incomplete data and natural variation. [93] Minerals can also be tested for taste or smell. Halite , NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, sylvite , has a pronounced bitter taste. Sulfides have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered. [91] Radioactivity is a rare property found in minerals containing radioactive elements. The radioactive elements could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in uraninite , autunite , and carnotite , or present as trace impurities, as in zircon . The decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal structure rendering it locally amorphous ( metamict state ); the optical result, termed a radioactive halo or pleochroic halo , is observable with various techniques, such as thin-section petrography .

In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be in six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the perovskite structure or the quartz polymorph stishovite (SiO 2 ). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of rutile (TiO 2 ), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si 4+ to be substituted by  Al 3+ because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those cases, the [AlO 4 ] 5− tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different. [102] The degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites): [103] [104] The silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.",

        "text": "Tectosilicates, also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the feldspars , feldspathoids , and the zeolites . Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds. [105] Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO 2 ) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite , and ultra-high pressure stishovite . The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been compressed so much that it has changed from a silicate structure to that of rutile (TiO 2 ). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573 °C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a \"kinking\" of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α). [100] [106] Feldspars are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al 3+ substitutes for Si 4+ , which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either [AlSi 3 O 8 ] − or [Al 2 Si 2 O 8 ] 2− There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – celsian and banalsite . The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich albite ; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich anorthite . Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare. [107] Feldspathoids are structurally similar to feldspar, but differ in that they form in Si-deficient conditions, which allows for further substitution by Al 3+ . As a result, feldspathoids are almost never found in association with quartz. A common example of a feldspathoid is nepheline ((Na, K)AlSiO 4 ); compared to alkali feldspar, nepheline has an Al 2 O 3 :SiO 2 ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in alkali feldspar. [108] Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment. [109]",

        "text": "Phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important examples include the mica , chlorite , and the kaolinite - serpentine groups. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balance out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. [Si 4 O 10 ] 4− ) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate layers. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral. [110] The layers are weakly bound by van der Waals forces , hydrogen bonds , or sparse ionic bonds , which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates. [111] The kaolinite-serpentine group consists of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral. [112] Micas are also T-O-T-stacked phyllosilicates, but differ from the other T-O-T and T-O-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have Al 3+ in octahedral sites). Common examples of micas are muscovite , and the biotite series. Mica T-O-T layers are bonded together by metal ions, giving them a greater hardness than other phyllosilicate minerals, though they retain perfect basal cleavage. [113] The chlorite group is related to mica group, but a brucite -like (Mg(OH) 2 ) layer between the T-O-T stacks. [114] Because of their chemical structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes. Micas can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. Chrysotile, a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos. [115]",

These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. [Si 2 O 6 ] 4− ), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. [Si 8 O 22 ] 12− . Inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly pyroxenes , while double-chain silicates are often amphiboles . [116] Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare. [117] The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species. [118] Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY(Si 2 O 6 ), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca 2+ , Fe 2+ and Mg 2+ to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks. [119] Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a \"mineralogical garbage can\" or a \"mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements\". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si 8 O 22 ] 12− ; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH] − ), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion. [120] Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca 2+ , Fe 2+ and Mg 2+ . [118] Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis ; amphibole asbestos ( anthophyllite , tremolite , actinolite , grunerite , and riebeckite ) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos.

The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour.

[127] Also termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g. SiO 4 ). Typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard. [128] Several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group. The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al 2 SiO 5 – are structurally composed of one [SiO 4 ] 4− tetrahedron, and one Al 3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al 3+ can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe) 2 SiO 4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite , Mn 2 SiO 4 . [129] The garnet group has a general formula of X 3 Y 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 , where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al 3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ), almandine (Fe 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ), and spessartine (Mn 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ). The ugrandite garnets have Ca 2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca 3 Cr 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ), grossular (Ca 3 Al 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ) and andradite (Ca 3 Fe 2 (SiO 4 ) 3 ). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members. [127] Other orthosilicates include zircon , staurolite , and topaz . Zircon (ZrSiO 4 ) is useful in geochronology as U 6+ can substitute for Zr 4+ ; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al 2 SiO 4 (F, OH) 2 , often found in granitic pegmatites associated with tourmaline , is a common gemstone mineral. [130]",

Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes. The gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are kamacite and taenite , which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of native iron , whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic traits; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite. [131]",

Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits. [132] Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1. [133] Many sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores ; examples include sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, galena (PbS), an ore of lead, cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, and molybdenite (MoS 2 , an ore of molybdenum. [134] Pyrite (FeS 2 ), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid . [135] Related to the sulfides are the rare sulfosalts , in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as antimony , arsenic , or bismuth .

The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum , CaSO 4 ⋅2H 2 O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses . Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite ; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO 4 , where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO 4 ), celestine (SrSO 4 ), and anglesite (PbSO 4 ); anhydrite is not part of the barite group, as the smaller Ca 2+ is only in eight-fold coordination. [148]",

[50] The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases . [51] Salts have diverse mineralities depending on their source, giving each one a unique flavour. Fleur de sel , a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a distinctive flavour varying with its source. In traditional Korean cuisine , so-called \" bamboo salt \" is prepared by roasting salt [52] in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang (a fermented bean paste). [53] Kosher or kitchen salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking. It can be useful for brining , in bread or pretzel making, and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil. [54] Pickling salt is made of ultra-fine grains to speed dissolving to make brine .",

        "text": "Food-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries (7% in Europe), [79] although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production. [80] In 2018, total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes , the top six producers being China (68 million), the United States (42 million), India (29 million), Germany (13 million), Canada (13 million) and Australia (12 million). [81] The manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. [82] A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. [2] This means that there are about 35 g (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts , predominantly sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions , per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water. [83] The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated. [77] The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity. [84] Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These sources are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, purification was achieved in shallow open pans that were heated to accelerate evaporation. Vacuum -based methods are also employed. [78] The raw salt is refined by treatment with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then applied. [85] Some salt is produced using the Alberger process , which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. [86] The Ayoreo , an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco , obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree ( Maytenus vitis-idaea ) and other trees. [87] The largest mine operated by underground workings in the world is the Sifto mine, located mostly 550 meters below Lake Huron, in Goderich, Ontario (Canada). About seven million tons of salt are extracted from it annually. [88] The Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and 400 km (250 mi) of passages. The salt is dug out by the room and pillar method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of Himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum.The mine is also a major tourist attraction, receiving around a quarter of a million visitors a year.

        "text": "Salt has long held an important place in religion and culture. At the time of Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks at the time of the new moon , salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. [90] The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. [91] In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water. [92] Salt is considered to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. [93] In Jainism , devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. [94] Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral , a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. [95] In Shinto , Shio ( 塩 , lit. \"salt\" ) is used for ritual purification of locations and people ( harae , specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the twofold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons. [ citation needed ] In the Hebrew Bible , there are thirty-five verses which mention salt . [96] One of these mentions Lot's wife , who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah ( Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem , he is said to have \" sown salt on it,\" probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. \"Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?\" (Job 6:6). [96] In the New Testament , six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus referred to his followers as the \" salt of the earth \". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to \"let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt\" (Colossians 4:6). [96] Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass . [97] Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism ) of the Celtic Consecration ( cf. Gallican Rite ) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water \"where it is customary\" in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water. [97] In Judaism , it is recommended to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat . It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush. [98] To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt. [91] In Wicca , salt is symbolic of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar , and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and ceremonies. [99]",

        "section": "Wilderness areas",
        "text": "On federal lands in the United States, Congress may designate an area as wilderness under the provisions of the Wilderness Act of 1964. [11] Multiple agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management , the National Park Service , the Fish and Wildlife Service , and the U.S. Forest Service , are responsible for the submission of new areas that fit the criteria to become wilderness to Congress. Congress then reviews these cases on a state by state basis and determines which areas and how much land in each area will become part of the WPS.  There have been multiple occasions in which Congress designated more federal land than had been recommended by the nominating agency. [12] Where as the Wilderness Act stipulated that a wilderness area must be \"administered for the use and enjoyment of the American people in such a manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness\", [12] the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act of 1975, which added 16 national forest areas to the NWPS, allowed for the inclusion of areas that had been severely modified by human interference. The Wilderness Act provides criteria for lands being considered for wilderness designation. Though there are some exceptions, the following conditions must be present for an area to be included in the NWPS: (1) the land is under federal ownership and management, (2) the area consists of at least five thousand acres of land, (3) human influence is \"substantially unnoticeable,\" (4) there are opportunities for solitude and recreation, and (5) the area possesses \"ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.\" [1] Wilderness areas are subject to specific management restrictions; human activities are limited to non-motorized recreation (such as backpacking , camping , hunting , fishing , horseback riding, etc.), scientific research , and other non-invasive activities. During these activities, patrons are asked to abide by the Leave No Trace policy. This policy sets guidelines for using the wilderness responsibly and leaving the area as it was before usage. These guidelines include: Packing all trash out of the wilderness, using a stove as opposed to a fire, camping at least 200 feet (61 m) from trails or water sources, staying on marked trails, and keeping group size small.  When closely observed, the Leave No Trace ethos ensures that wilderness areas remain untainted by human interaction. [13] In general, the law prohibits logging , mining , motorized or mechanized vehicles (including bicycles ), road-building, and other forms of development in wilderness areas, though pre-existing mining claims and grazing ranges are permitted through grandfather clauses in the Wilderness Act. [14] Wilderness areas fall into IUCN protected area management category Ia (strict nature preserves) or Ib (wilderness areas). A special exemption to the rule against mechanized equipment is made for wilderness areas in Alaska : limited use of motorized vehicles and construction of cabins and aquaculture are permitted. [1] These exemptions were allowed due to the large amount of wilderness in Alaska and the concerns of subsistence users, including Alaska Natives . Wilderness areas are parts of national parks , wildlife refuges , national forests , and BLM lands; some units are managed by different agencies. Initially, the NWPS included 34 areas protecting 9.1 million acres (37,000 km 2 ) in the national forests. As of 2023, there are 806 areas in the NWPS, preserving 111,889,002 acres (45,279,873 ha). [2] This is approximately 4.5% of the entire United States , though only about 2.7% of the 48 contiguous states. However, most of that acreage is located in a handful of states. The states with the highest number of wildernesses are California , Arizona , Nevada , Alaska , and Oregon . However, when measured in acres the list changes dramatically, as Alaska contains many of the largest areas protected under the act. In terms of total acres, Alaska , California , Arizona , Idaho , and Washington are the top five states for wilderness, containing almost 80 percent of the acreage in the system. [2] Wilderness totals in most eastern states are modest, with the exceptions of Florida and Minnesota . Wilderness areas exist in every state except Connecticut , Delaware , Iowa , Kansas , Maryland , and Rhode Island . [8] Most U.S. wilderness areas are in national forests, but the largest amount of wilderness land is administered by the National Park Service. The largest contiguous wilderness complex in the United States is the Noatak and Gates of the Arctic Wildernesses in Alaska at 12,743,329 acres (5,157,042 ha). The largest wilderness area outside Alaska is the Death Valley Wilderness in southeastern California. The smallest area protected by the WPS is the Pelican Island Wilderness in northern Florida , which measures just 6 acres (2.4 ha) total.  The smallest area preserved in the system was formerly the Rocks and Islands Wilderness in Northern California at 5 acres (2.0 ha), but after a reassessment by the Bureau of Land Management in 2006 it was officially expanded to 19 acres (7.7 ha).",

[12] Many of the species found in the United States are represented in wilderness areas. There are 261 basic ecosystems in the U.S., and 157 of them are represented in the system. With 60% of all ecosystems somewhat protected by the NWPS, much of the wildlife in the U.S. also has an area in which to exist without significant human interaction. [12] In late 2011, a full wilderness review was requested of the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain in Alaska.  One of the major qualifications for this area to be considered as a possible wilderness area was its diverse wildlife population, many of which are on the endangered species list. [12] In this potential wilderness area alone, whales , seals , wolves , polar bears , grizzly bears , muskoxen , caribou , and over 200 species of migratory birds call this one area home for at least part of the year. This vast assortment of flora and fauna is a major consideration for addition into the wilderness preservation system. [16]",

With this process fast growing pinewood acquires properties similar to tropical hardwood. Production facilities for this process are in The Netherlands and is known under the trade name “NobelWood”. From agricultural waste, like sugarcane bagasse, furfuryl alcohol is manufactured. Theoretically this alcohol can be from any fermented bio-mass waste and therefore can be called a green chemical. After condensation reactions pre-polymers are formed from furfuryl alcohol. Fast growing softwood is impregnated with the water-soluble bio-polymer. After impregnation the wood is dried and heated which initiates a polymerisation reaction between the bio-polymer and the wood cells. This process results in wood cells which are resistant to microorganisms. At the moment the only timber species which is being used for this process is Pinus radiata . This is the fastest growing tree species on Earth that has a porous structure which is particularly suitable for impregnation processes. The technique is applied to timber mainly for the building industry as a cladding material. The technique is being further developed in order to reach similar physical and biological properties of other polyfurfuryl impregnated wood species. Besides the impregnation with the biopolymers the timber can also be impregnated with fire retardant resins. This combination creates a timber with durability class I and a fire safety certification of Euro class B.",

        "text": "Chemical modification of wood at the molecular level has been used to improve its performance properties. Many chemical reaction systems for the modification of wood, especially those using various types of anhydrides , have been published; however, the reaction of wood with acetic anhydride has been the most studied. [23] [24] [25] The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called free hydroxyls . Free hydroxyl groups readily absorb and release water according to changes in the climatic conditions to which they are exposed. This is the main reason why wood's dimensional stability is impacted by swelling and shrinking. It is also believed that the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites, which is one of the principal reasons why wood is prone to decay. [26] Acetylation effectively changes the compounds with free hydroxyls within wood into acetate esters . [27] This is done by reacting the wood with acetic anhydride , which comes from acetic acid . When free hydroxyl groups are transformed to acetoxy groups, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is no longer digestible, extremely durable. In general, softwoods naturally have an acetyl content from 0.5 to 1.5% and more durable hardwoods from 2 to 4.5%. Acetylation takes wood well beyond these levels with corresponding benefits. These include an extended coatings life due to acetylated wood acting as a more stable substrate for paints and translucent coatings. acetylated wood is non-toxic and does not have the environmental issues associated with traditional preservation techniques. The acetylation of wood was first done in Germany in 1928 by Fuchs. In 1946, Tarkow, Stamm and Erickson first described the use of wood acetylation to stabilize wood from swelling in water. Since the 1940s, many laboratories around the world have looked at acetylation of many different types of woods and agricultural resources. In spite of the vast amount of research on chemical modification of wood, and, more specifically, on the acetylation of wood, commercialization did not come easily. The first patent on the acetylation of wood was filed by Suida in Austria in 1930. Later, in 1947, Stamm and Tarkow filed a patent on the acetylation of wood and boards using pyridine as a catalyst. In 1961, the Koppers Company published a technical bulletin on the acetylation of wood using no catalysis, but with an organic cosolvent [28] In 1977, in Russia, Otlesnov and Nikitina came close to commercialization, but the process was discontinued, presumably because cost-effectiveness could not be achieved. In 2007, Titan Wood, a London-based company, with production facilities in The Netherlands, achieved cost-effective commercialization and began large-scale production of acetylated wood under the trade name \"Accoya\".
