        "text": "Gold deposits are formed via a very wide variety of geological processes. Deposits are classified as primary, alluvial or placer deposits, or residual or laterite deposits. Often a deposit will contain a mixture of all three types of ore. Plate tectonics is the underlying mechanism for generating gold deposits. The majority of primary gold deposits fall into two main categories: lode gold deposits or intrusion -related deposits. Lode gold deposits , also referred to as orogenic gold are generally high-grade, thin, vein and fault hosted. They are primarily made up of quartz veins also known as lodes or reefs , which contain either native gold or gold sulfides and tellurides . Lode gold deposits are usually hosted in basalt or in sediments known as turbidite , although when in faults , they may occupy intrusive igneous rocks such as granite . Lode-gold deposits are intimately associated with orogeny and other plate collision events within geologic history. It is thought that most lode gold deposits are sourced from metamorphic rocks by the dehydration of basalt during metamorphism. The gold is transported up faults by hydrothermal waters and deposited when the water cools too much to retain gold in solution. Intrusive related gold (Lang & Baker, 2001) is generally hosted in granites, porphyry , or rarely dikes . Intrusive related gold usually also contains copper , and is often associated with tin and tungsten , and rarely molybdenum , antimony , and uranium . Intrusive-related gold deposits rely on gold existing in the fluids associated with the magma (White, 2001), and the inevitable discharge of these hydrothermal fluids into the wall-rocks (Lowenstern, 2001). Skarn deposits are another manifestation of intrusive-related deposits. Placer deposits are sourced from pre-existing gold deposits and are secondary deposits. Placer deposits are formed by alluvial processes within rivers and streams, and on beaches . Placer gold deposits form via gravity , with the density of gold causing it to sink into trap sites within the river bed, or where water velocity drops, such as bends in rivers and behind boulders. Often placer deposits are found within sedimentary rocks and can be billions of years old, for instance the Witwatersrand deposits in South Africa . Sedimentary placer deposits are known as 'leads' or 'deep leads'. Placer deposits are often worked by fossicking , and panning for gold is a popular pastime. Laterite gold deposits are formed from pre-existing gold deposits (including some placer deposits) during prolonged weathering of the bedrock. Gold is deposited within iron oxides in the weathered rock or regolith , and may be further enriched by reworking by erosion. Some laterite deposits are formed by wind erosion of the bedrock leaving a residuum of native gold metal at surface. A bacterium, Cupriavidus metallidurans , plays a vital role in the formation of gold nuggets by precipitating metallic gold from a solution of gold (III) tetrachloride , a compound highly toxic to most other microorganisms. [8] Similarly, Delftia acidovorans can form gold nuggets. [9]",

The uranium is brought into solution by acidic conditions and is deposited when this acidity is neutralised. Generally this occurs in certain carbon-bearing sediments, within an unconformity in sedimentary strata. The majority of the world's nuclear power is sourced from uranium in such deposits. Uranium is also found in nearly all coal at several parts per million , and in all granites. Radon is a common problem during mining of uranium as it is a radioactive gas. Uranium is also found associated with certain igneous rocks, such as granite and porphyry . The Olympic Dam deposit in Australia is an example of this type of uranium deposit. It contains 70% of Australia's share of 40% of the known global low-cost recoverable uranium inventory.",

The basic themes of uranium ore genesis are host mineralogy, reduction-oxidation potential , and porosity . Uranium is a highly soluble and radioactive heavy metal . It can be easily dissolved, transported and precipitated within groundwater by subtle changes in oxidation conditions. Uranium does not usually form very insoluble mineral species, which is a further factor in the wide variety of geological conditions and places in which uranium mineralization may accumulate. Uranium is an incompatible element within magmas , and as such it tends to become accumulated within highly fractionated and evolved granite melts, particularly alkaline examples.

[11] Primary mineralization consists of pitchblende and coffinite, with weathering producing secondary mineralization. Sandstone deposits constitute about 18% of world uranium resources. Orebodies of this type are commonly low to medium grade (0.05â0.4% U 3 O 8 ) and individual orebodies are small to medium in size (ranging up to a maximum of 50,000 t U 3 O 8 ). [13] Sandstone hosted uranium deposits are widespread globally and span a broad range of host rock ages.

        "section": "Vein deposits",
        "text": "Vein deposits play a special role in the history of uranium: the term \"pitchblende\" (\" pechblende \") originates from German vein deposits when they were mined for silver in the 16th century. Franz Ernst BrÃ¼ckmann made the first mineralogical description of the mineral in 1727, and the vein deposit Jachymov in the Czech Republic became the type locality for uraninite. [21] In 1789 German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered the element uranium in a sample of pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt vein deposit. The first industrial production of uranium was made from the Jachymov deposit, and Marie and Pierre Curie used the tailings of the mine for their discovery of polonium and radium . Vein deposits consist of uranium minerals filling in cavities such as cracks, veins, fractures, breccias, and stockworks associated with steeply dipping fault systems. There are three major subtypes of vein style uranium mineralisation: Intragranitic veins form in the late phase of magmatic activity when hot fluids derived from the magma precipitate uranium on cracks within the newly formed granite. Such mineralisation contributed much to the uranium production of France. Veins hosted by metasedimentary units in the exocontact of granites are the most important sources of uranium mineralisation in central Europe including the world class deposits Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda in Germany (96,000 t uranium content) as well as Pribram (50,000 t uranium content) and Jachymov (~10,000 t uranium content) in the Czech Republic. Also they are closely related to the granites, the mineralization is much younger with a time gap between granite formation and mineralisation of 20 million years. The initial uranium mineralisation consists of quartz, carbonate , fluorite and pitchblende. Remobilisation of uranium occurred at later stages producing polymetal veins containing silver, cobalt , nickel , arsenic and other elements. Large deposits of this type can contain more than 1,000 individual mineralized veins. However, only 5 to 12% of the vein areas carry mineralization and although massive lenses of pitchblende can occur, the overall ore grade is only about 0.1% uranium. [22] [23] The Bohemian Massif contains shear zone hosted uranium deposits with the most important one being Rozna-Olsi in Moravia northwest of Brno . Rozna is currently the only operating uranium mine in central Europe with a total uranium content of 23,000 t and an average grade of 0.24%. The formation of this mineralisation occurred in several stages. After the Variscan orogeny , extension took place and hydrothermal fluids overprinted fine grained materials in shear zones with a sulfide-chlorite alteration. Fluids from the overlying sediments entered the basement mobilising uranium and while uprising on the shear zone, the chlorite-pyrite material caused precipitation of uranium minerals in form of coffinite, pitchblende and U-Zr-silicates. This initial mineralisation event took place at about 277 million to 264 million years. During the Triassic a further mineralisation event took place relocating uranium into quartz-carbonate-uranium veins. [24] Another example of this mineralisation style is the Shinkolobwe deposit in Congo containing about 30,000 t of uranium. [25]",

Supergene profiles can be developed above weathered examples of IOCG deposits, as exemplified by the Sossego deposit, Para State, Brazil , where typical oxidised copper minerals are present, e.g.; malachite , cuprite , native copper and minor amounts of digenite and chalcocite . Alteration is a mixture of sodic-calcic ( albite - epidote ) to potassic (K- feldspar ) in style, and may vary from province to province based on host rocks and mineralising processes. Typically for large-scale hydrothermal systems, fluid types within IOCG systems show a mixed provenance of magmatic, metamorphic and often meteoric waters. Deposits may be vertically zoned from deeper albite-magnetite assemblages trending toward silica-K-feldspar- sericite in the upper portions of the deposits. Gangue minerals are typically some form of iron oxide mineral, classically hematite , but also magnetite within some other examples such as Ernest Henry and some Argentinian examples. This is typically associated with gangue sulfides of pyrite, with subordinate pyrrhotite and other base metal sulfides. Silicate gangue minerals include actinolite , pyroxene , tourmaline , epidote and chlorite , with apatite , allanite and other phosphate minerals common in some IOCG provinces (e.g.; North American examples), with carbonate - barite assemblages also reported. Where present, rare-earth metals tend to associate with phosphate minerals. When iron oxide species trend towards magnetite or crystalline massive hematite, IOCG deposits may be economic based on their iron oxide contents alone. Several examples of IOCG deposits (Wilcherry Hill, Cairn Hill, Kiruna) are iron ore deposits.",

        "text": "Iron is the world's most commonly used metalâsteel, of which iron ore is the key ingredient, represents almost 95% of all metal used per year. [3] It is used primarily in structures, ships, automobiles, and machinery. Iron-rich rocks are common worldwide, but ore-grade commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed in the table aside. The major constraint to economics for iron ore deposits is not necessarily the grade or size of the deposits, because it is not particularly hard to geologically prove enough tonnage of the rocks exist. The main constraint is the position of the iron ore relative to market, the cost of rail infrastructure to get it to market, and the energy cost required to do so. Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. [22] It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship. [22] For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands of a few major players. World production averages 2,000,000,000Â t (2.0 Ã 10 9 long tons; 2.2 Ã 10 9 short tons) of raw ore annually. The world's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation Vale , followed by Australian companies Rio Tinto Group and BHP . A further Australian supplier, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, has helped bring Australia's production to first in the world. The seaborne trade in iron oreâthat is, iron ore to be shipped to other countriesâwas 849,000,000Â t (836,000,000 long tons; 936,000,000 short tons) in 2004. [22] Australia and Brazil dominate the seaborne trade, with 72% of the market. [22] BHP, Rio and Vale control 66% of this market between them. [22] In Australia , iron ore is won from three main sources: pisolite \" channel iron deposit \" ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such as at Pannawonica, Western Australia ; and the dominant metasomatically-altered banded iron formation -related ores such as at Newman , the Chichester Range , the Hamersley Range and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently, [ when? ] such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps, for instance laterite iron ore deposits near Lake Argyle in Western Australia. The total recoverable reserves of iron ore in India are about 9,602,000,000Â t (9.450 Ã 10 9 long tons; 1.0584 Ã 10 10 short tons) of hematite and 3,408,000,000Â t (3.354 Ã 10 9 long tons; 3.757 Ã 10 9 short tons) of magnetite . [23] Chhattisgarh , Madhya Pradesh , Karnataka , Jharkhand , Odisha , Goa , Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , Kerala , Rajasthan , and Tamil Nadu are the principal Indian producers of iron ore. World consumption of iron ore grows 10% per year [ citation needed ] on average with the main consumers being China, Japan, Korea, the United States, and the European Union. China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore, which translates to be the world's largest steel producing country. It is also the largest importer, buying 52% of the seaborne trade in iron ore in 2004. [22] China is followed by Japan and Korea, which consume a significant amount of raw iron ore and metallurgical coal . In 2006, China produced 588,000,000Â t (579,000,000 long tons; 648,000,000 short tons) of iron ore, with an annual growth of 38%.",

        "text": "Over the last 40 years, iron ore prices have been decided in closed-door negotiations between the small handful of miners and steelmakers which dominate both spot and contract markets. Traditionally, the first deal reached between these two groups sets a benchmark to be followed by the rest of the industry. [3] In recent years [ when? ] , however, this benchmark system has begun to break down, with participants along both demand and supply chains calling for a shift to short-term pricing. Given that most other commodities already have a mature market-based pricing system, it is natural for iron ore to follow suit. To answer increasing market demands for more transparent pricing, a number of financial exchanges and clearing houses around the world have offered iron ore swaps clearing. The CME group, SGX (Singapore Exchange), London Clearing House (LCH.Clearnet), NOS Group, and ICEX (Indian Commodities Exchange) all offer cleared swaps based on The Steel Index's (TSI) iron ore transaction data. The CME also offers a Platts-based swap, in addition to their TSI swap clearing. The ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) offers a Platts-based swap clearing service also. The swaps market has grown quickly, with liquidity clustering around TSI's pricing. [26] By April 2011, over US$5.5Â billion worth of iron ore swaps have been cleared basis TSI prices. By August 2012, in excess of one million tonnes of swaps trading per day was taking place regularly, basis TSI. A relatively new development has also been the introduction of iron ore options, in addition to swaps. The CME group has been the venue most used for clearing of options written against TSI, with open interest at over 12,000 lots in August 2012. Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) has launched the world's first global iron ore futures contract, based on the Metal Bulletin Iron Ore Index (MBIOI) which uses daily price data from a broad spectrum of industry participants and independent Chinese steel consultancy and data provider Shanghai Steelhome's widespread contact base of steel producers and iron ore traders across China. [27] The futures contract has seen monthly volumes over 1,500,000Â t (1,500,000 long tons; 1,700,000 short tons) after eight months of trading. [28] This move follows a switch to index-based quarterly pricing by the world's three largest iron ore minersâ Vale , Rio Tinto , and BHP âin early 2010, breaking a 40-year tradition of benchmark annual pricing.

        "text": "The heavy minerals within the source sediments attain an economic concentration by accumulation within low-energy environments in streams and most usually on beaches. In beach placer deposits the lowest energy zone on the beach is the swash zone , where turbulent surf washes up on the beach face and loses energy. In this zone heavier grains accumulate and become stranded because they are denser than the quartz grains they accompany. It is for this reason that beach placer deposits are often referred to as \"strand-line deposits\". The size and position of a heavy mineral deposit is a function of the wave energy reaching the beach, the mean grainsize of the beach sediments, and the current height of the ocean. Anecdotal reports of certain beach placers forming in modern times suggest that the greatest enrichment tended to occur in storm events energetic enough to remove most of the beach's sediment loadâa process favoring the lighter minerals. The resultant 'clinker' sands left behind were mined during low tide following major storm events, suggesting that most beach placer deposits are formed during such cycles. Fossilised dune systems often are exploited for heavy mineral sands because they are from the ocean and because they are often remnants of previous intraglacial highstands . Tectonic activity, which results in coastlines rising from the ocean, may also cause a beach system to become stranded above the high-water mark and lock in the heavy mineral sands. Similarly, a beach system that is drowned by the subsidence of a coastline may be preserved, often for millions of years, until it either is covered by sedimentation or rises from the ocean. Specific trap sites for heavy mineral sand placer deposits are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, where low-energy zones trap sediments carried along by the longshore drift . Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers that feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves is most efficient, because heavy minerals too heavy to be moved will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting farther down the beach.",

        "text": "The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent, location and value of the ore body. This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit. This estimation is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit. This identifies, early on, whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work. The next step is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project. This is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the metallurgy and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area. To gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the ore body. Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation. Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering, development begins to create access to the ore body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, reclamation can begin, to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use. Technical and economic challenges notwithstanding, successful mine development must also address human factors. Working conditions are paramount to success, especially with regard to exposures to dusts, radiation, noise, explosives hazards, and vibration, as well as illumination standards. Mining today increasingly must address environmental and community impacts, including psychological and sociological dimensions. Thus, mining educator Frank T. M. White (1909â1971), broadened the focus to the âtotal environment of miningâ, including reference to community development around mining, and how mining is portrayed to an urban society, which depends on the industry, although seemingly unaware of this dependency. He stated, â[I]n the past, mining engineers have not been called upon to study the psychological, sociological and personal problems of their own industry â aspects that nowadays are assuming tremendous importance. The mining engineer must rapidly expand his knowledge and his influence into these newer fields.â [41]",

Today, surface mining is much more common, and produces, for example, 85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States, including 98% of metallic ores. [42] Targets are divided into two general categories of materials: placer deposits , consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels, beach sands, and other unconsolidated materials ; and lode deposits , where valuable minerals are found in veins, in layers, or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock. Both types of ore deposit, placer or lode, are mined by both surface and underground methods. [ citation needed ] Some mining, including much of the rare earth elements and uranium mining , is done by less-common methods, such as in-situ leaching : this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground. The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble, e.g., potash , potassium chloride , sodium chloride , sodium sulfate , which dissolve in water. Some minerals, such as copper minerals and uranium oxide , require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve. [43] Explosives in Mining Explosives have been used in surface mining and sub-surface mining to blast out rock and ore intended for processing. The most common explosive used in mining is ammonium nitrate . [44] Between 1870 and 1920, in Queensland Australia, an increase in mining accidents lead to more safety measures surrounding the use of explosives for mining. [45] In the United States of America, between 1990 and 1999, about 22.3 billion kilograms of explosives were used in mining quarrying and other industries; Moreover \" coal mining used 66.4%, nonmetal mining and quarrying 13.5%, metal mining 10.4%, construction 7.1%, and all other users 2.6%\".

Most placer deposits, because they are shallowly buried, are mined by surface methods. Finally, landfill mining involves sites where landfills are excavated and processed.

As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutter-head is progressively launched further into the coal seam. High wall mining can produce thousands of tons of coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams. [ citation needed ]",

Drift mining uses horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining uses vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations requires different techniques. [53] Other methods include shrinkage stope mining , which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining , which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and room and pillar mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room. Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining , in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining , bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving . [ citation needed ]",

Environmental monitoring during operation and after closure may also be required. Government regulations may not be well enforced, especially in the developing world.

These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles , IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing . Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry self-regulation . [64] In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead. [65] This was followed by the Global Mining Initiative which was begun by nine of the largest metals and mining companies and which led to the formation of the International Council on Mining and Metals , whose purpose was to \"act as a catalyst\" in an effort to improve social and environmental performance in the mining and metals industry internationally. [64] The mining industry has provided funding to various conservation groups, some of which have been working with conservation agendas that are at odds with an emerging acceptance of the rights of indigenous people â particularly the right to make land-use decisions.

Tailings, which are usually produced as a slurry , are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys. [70] These ponds are secured by impoundments ( dams or embankment dams ). [70] In 2000 it was estimated that 3,500 tailings impoundments existed, and that every year, 2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred. [71] For example, in the Marcopper mining disaster at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river. [71] In 2015, Barrick Gold Corporation spilled over 1 million liters of cyanide into a total of five rivers in Argentina near their Veladero mine . [72] Since 2007 in central Finland, the Talvivaara Terrafame polymetal mine's waste effluent and leaks of saline mine water have resulted in ecological collapse of a nearby lake. [73] Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option. [70] The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal (STD), which disposes of tailings in the sea, is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds. The practice is illegal in the United States and Canada , but it is used in the developing world. [74] The waste is classified as either sterile or mineralized, with acid generating potential, and the movement and storage of this material form a major part of the mine planning process. When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut-off, the near-grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable. Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps, and special conditions apply to high-rainfall areas and to seismically active areas. Waste dump designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located. It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard, which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied. [71]",

        "text": "Mining exists in many countries. London is the headquarters for large miners such as Anglo American , BHP and Rio Tinto . [75] The US mining industry is also large, but it is dominated by extraction of coal and other nonmetal minerals (e.g., rock and sand), and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States. [75] In 2007, the total market capitalization of mining companies was reported at US$962Â billion, which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50Â trillion in 2007. [76] In 2002, Chile and Peru were reportedly the major mining countries of South America . [77] The mineral industry of Africa includes the mining of various minerals; it produces relatively little of the industrial metals copper , lead , and zinc , but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40% of gold , 60% of cobalt , and 90% of the world's platinum group metals. [78] Mining in India is a significant part of that country's economy. In the developed world, mining in Australia , with BHP founded and headquartered in the country, and mining in Canada are particularly significant. For rare earth minerals mining, China reportedly controlled 95% of production in 2013. [79] While exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, companies, most of them publicly listed . It can be argued that what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies, called \"juniors\", which are dependent on venture capital . The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations. Various other industries such as equipment manufacture, environmental testing, and metallurgy analysis rely on, and support, the mining industry throughout the world. Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies, particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange ; Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally. [75] Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices. [75] Mining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction , coal mining , metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. [80] Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains one of the largest in terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites . Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom (\"commodities supercycle\") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining ; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003â2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006â2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.

        "text": "New regulations and a process of legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral-rich countries. [83] New legislation for mining industry in African countries still appears to be an issue, but has the potential to be solved, when a consensus is reached on the best approach. [84] By the beginning of the 21st century, the booming and increasingly complex mining sector in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by NGOs and local communities called for new approaches which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards sustainable development even after mine closure (including transparency and revenue management). By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects. [84] Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The Fraser Institute (a Canadian think tank) has highlighted [ clarification needed ] the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact. [85] In 2007, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was mainstreamed [ clarification needed ] in all countries cooperating with the World Bank in mining industry reform. [84] The EITI operates and was implemented with the support of the EITI multi-donor trust fund, managed by the World Bank. [86] The EITI aims to increase transparency in transactions between governments and companies in extractive industries [87] by monitoring the revenues and benefits between industries and recipient governments. The entrance process is voluntary for each country and is monitored by multiple stakeholders including governments, private companies and civil society representatives, responsible for disclosure and dissemination of the reconciliation report; [84] however, the competitive disadvantage of company-by-company public report is for some of the businesses in Ghana at least, the main constraint. [88] Therefore, the outcome assessment in terms of failure or success of the new EITI regulation does not only \"rest on the government's shoulders\" but also on civil society and companies. [89] However, implementation has issues; inclusion or exclusion of artisanal mining and small-scale mining (ASM) from the EITI and how to deal with \"non-cash\" payments made by companies to subnational governments. Furthermore, the disproportionate revenues the mining industry can bring to the comparatively small number of people that it employs, [90] causes other problems, like a lack of investment in other less lucrative sectors, leading to swings in government revenue because of volatility in the oil markets. Artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic, D.R. Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone â i.e. almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI. [90] Among other things, limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills, thus far flexibility of the policy (e.g. liberty of the countries to expand beyond the minimum requirements and adapt it to their needs), creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation. Public awareness increase, where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered. [91]",

[92] Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2Â billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil, begun in 1981. [93] The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988, it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement. [64] :â20 In 1992, the World Bank began to push for privatization of government-owned mining companies with a new set of codes, beginning with its report The Strategy for African Mining . In 1997, Latin America's largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) was privatized. These and other developments, such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act, led the bank to publish a third report ( Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries ) which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and related measures. [64] :â22 The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but \"fall very short of permitting sustainable development\".

The CourriÃ¨res mine disaster , Europe's worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10, 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. [95] While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades, mining accidents still occur. Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year, while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000. [96] Between 1870 and 1920, in Queensland Australia, an increase in mining accidents lead to more safety measures surrounding the use of explosives for mining. [97] Mining accidents continue worldwide, including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster in Russia, the 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion in China, and the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in the United States. Mining has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. [98] The Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was established in 1978 to \"work to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners.\" [99] Since its implementation in 1978, the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 24 miners in 2019. [ citation needed ] There are numerous occupational hazards associated with mining, including exposure to rockdust which can lead to diseases such as silicosis , asbestosis , and pneumoconiosis . Gases in the mine can lead to asphyxiation and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for hearing loss . Cave-ins , rock falls , and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards. The current NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) of noise is 85 dBA with a 3 dBA exchange rate and the MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is 90 dBA with a 5 dBA exchange rate as an 8-hour time-weighted average. NIOSH has found that 25% of noise-exposed workers in Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction have hearing impairment. [100] The prevalence of hearing loss increased by 1% from 1991 to 2001 within these workers. [ citation needed ] Noise studies have been conducted in several mining environments. Stageloaders (84-102 dBA), shearers (85-99 dBA), auxiliary fans (84â120 dBA), continuous mining machines (78â109 dBA), and roof bolters (92â103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment in underground coal mines . [101] Dragline oilers, dozer operators, and welders using air arcing were occupations with the highest noise exposures among surface coal miners. [102] Coal mines had the highest hearing loss injury likelihood. [103]",

        "text": "During the 20th century, the variety of metals used in society grew rapidly. Today, the development of major nations such as China and India and advances in technologies are fueling an ever-greater demand. The result is that metal mining activities are expanding and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper . Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the US rose from 73 kilograms (161Â lb) to 238 kilograms (525Â lb) per person. [121] 95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material. [122] However, levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel , hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), published reports on metal stocks that exist within society [123] and their recycling rates. [121] The report's authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge anthropogenic mines above ground. [123] However, they warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars, and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology. [ citation needed ] As recycling rates are low and so much metal has already been extracted, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves. [124] This is especially true of aluminum , used in cans, and precious metals , found in discarded electronics. [125] Furthermore, waste after 15 years has still not broken down, so less processing would be required when compared to mining ores. A study undertaken by Cranfield University has found Â£360Â million of metals could be mined from just four landfill sites. [126] There is also up to 20Â MJ/kg of energy in waste, potentially making the re-extraction more profitable. [127] However, although the first landfill mine opened in Tel Aviv , Israel in 1953, little work has followed due to the abundance of accessible ores. [128]",
