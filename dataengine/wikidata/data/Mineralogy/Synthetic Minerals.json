        "text": "Only about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or ions , and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being dark matter . The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even less well understood dark energy ). The 94 naturally occurring chemical elements were produced by at least four classes of astrophysical process. Most of the hydrogen, helium and a very small quantity of lithium were produced in the first few minutes of the Big Bang . This Big Bang nucleosynthesis happened only once; the other processes are ongoing. Nuclear fusion inside stars produces elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, including all elements from carbon to iron in atomic number. Elements higher in atomic number than iron, including heavy elements like uranium and plutonium, are produced by various forms of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae and neutron star mergers . The light elements lithium , beryllium and boron are produced mostly through cosmic ray spallation (fragmentation induced by cosmic rays ) of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. During the early phases of the Big Bang, nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 ( protium , 1 H) and helium-4 ( 4 He), as well as a smaller amount of deuterium ( 2 H) and very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10 −10 ) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very old stars, while carbon has not. [22] No elements heavier than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% 1 H, 25% 4 He, and 0.01% deuterium, with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and perhaps boron. [23] Subsequent enrichment of galactic halos occurred due to stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis . [24] However, the element abundance in intergalactic space can still closely resemble primordial conditions, unless it has been enriched by some means. On Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of nuclear transmutation processes. These include some produced by cosmic rays or other nuclear reactions (see cosmogenic and nucleogenic nuclides), and others produced as decay products of long-lived primordial nuclides. [25] For example, trace (but detectable) amounts of carbon-14 ( 14 C) are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting nitrogen atoms, and argon-40 ( 40 Ar) is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium-40 ( 40 K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive actinides, thorium, uranium, and plutonium, decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and radon , which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds. Three other radioactive elements, technetium, promethium, and neptunium, occur only incidentally in natural materials, produced as individual atoms by nuclear fission of the nuclei of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes. In addition to the 94 naturally occurring elements, several artificial elements have been produced by human nuclear physics technology. As of 2021 [update] , these experiments have produced all elements up to atomic number 118.",

        "text": "The following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our Solar System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million , by mass . [26] Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the visible universe , however, scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance. The abundance of elements in the Solar System is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang and a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays). Beginning with carbon, elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovas . Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with their atomic number. The abundance of the chemical elements on Earth varies from air to crust to ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust differs from that in the Solar System (as seen in the Sun and heavy planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon (as hydrocarbons), nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system. Oxygen, the most abundant Earth element by mass, is retained on Earth by combination with silicon. Aluminium at 8% by mass is more common in the Earth's crust than in the universe and solar system, but the composition of the far more bulky mantle, which has magnesium and iron in place of aluminium (which occurs there only at 2% of mass) more closely mirrors the elemental composition of the solar system, save for the noted loss of volatile elements to space, and loss of iron which has migrated to the Earth's core. The composition of the human body , by contrast, more closely follows the composition of seawater —save that the human body has additional stores of carbon and nitrogen necessary to form the proteins and nucleic acids , together with phosphorus in the nucleic acids and energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that occurs in the cells of all living organisms. Certain kinds of organisms require particular additional elements, for example the magnesium in chlorophyll in green plants, the calcium in mollusc shells , or the iron in the hemoglobin in vertebrate animals ' red blood cells .",

The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers (the Oddo–Harkins rule ), and (2) a general decrease in abundance as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae."

        "section": "Characteristics and classification",
        "text": "The traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the ancient Greeks , begins with a distinction between precious and semi-precious ; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use, the precious stones are emerald , ruby , sapphire and diamond , with all other gemstones being semi-precious. [9] This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are translucent , with fine color in their purest forms (except for the colorless diamond), and very hard with a hardness score of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale . [10] Other stones are classified by their color, translucency , and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values; for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald. [11] Another traditional term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone . Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it suggests certain stones are more valuable than others when this is not reflected in the actual market value, although it would generally be correct if referring to desirability. In modern times gemstones are identified by gemologists , who describe gems and their characteristics using technical terminology specific to the field of gemology . The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its chemical composition . For example, diamonds are made of carbon ( C ) and rubies of aluminium oxide ( Al 2 O 3 ). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their crystal system such as cubic or trigonal or monoclinic . Another term used is habit , the form the gem is usually found in. [12] For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as octahedrons . [13] Gemstones are classified into different groups , species , and varieties . [14] [15] For example, ruby is the red variety of the species corundum , while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), red beryl (red), goshenite (colorless), heliodor (yellow), and morganite (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species beryl . Gems are characterized in terms of their color (hue, tone and saturation), optical phenomena, luster, refractive index , birefringence , dispersion , specific gravity , hardness , cleavage , and fracture . [16] [17] They may exhibit pleochroism or double refraction . They may have luminescence and a distinctive absorption spectrum . Gemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\". [18] Very transparent gems are considered \" first water \", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency. [19] Additionally, material or flaws within a stone may be present as inclusions . [20]",

        "text": "Gemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision). [21] A mnemonic device , the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help describe the factors used to grade a diamond. With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weights depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, the cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. An ideally cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity, and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality. [22] Physical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual optical phenomena within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) [23] and asteria (star effects). Apart from the more generic and commonly used gemstones such as  from diamonds , rubies , sapphires , and emeralds , pearls and opal [24] have also been defined as precious in the jewellery trade. Up to the discoveries of bulk amethyst in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a \"precious stone\" as well, going back to ancient Greece. Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine , peridot and cat's eye ( cymophane ) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious, thus reinforcing the notion that a mineral's rarity may have been implicated in its classification as a precious stone and thus contribute to its value. Today the gemstone trade no longer makes such a distinction. [25] Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand-name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc. Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones. [26] Rare or unusual gemstones, generally understood to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include andalusite , axinite , cassiterite , clinohumite , painite and red beryl . [27] Gemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics in the quality of the stone. These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom from defects, the beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for such stones. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate. [28] In the addition to the aesthetic and adorning/ornamental purpose of gemstones, there are many proponents of energy medicine who also value gemstones on the basis of their alleged healing powers. [29] A gemstone that has been rising in popularity is Cuprian Elbaite Tourmaline which is also called \"Paraiba Tourmaline\". It was first discovered in the late 1980s in Paraíba, Brazil and later in Mozambique and Nigeria. [30] It is famous for its glowing neon blue color. Paraiba Tourmaline has become one of the most popular gemstones in recent times thanks to its color and is considered to be one of the important gemstones after rubies, emeralds, and sapphires according to Gübelin Gemlab. Even though it is a tourmaline, Paraiba Tourmaline is one of the most expensive gemstones. [31]",

The two main classifications are as follows: Stones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as opal , turquoise , variscite , etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color, luster and other surface properties as opposed to internal reflection properties like brilliance. [35] Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape, and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones. [36] Gems that are transparent are normally faceted, a method that shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for faceted stones . The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the optical properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets. [37] Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.",

        "text": "The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. [38] A ruby appears red because it absorbs all other colors of white light while reflecting red. A material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are corundum ) [39] but exhibit different colors because of impurities which absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light depending on their individual compositions. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \" padparadscha sapphire \". [40] This difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called impurities are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected. For example, beryl , which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If manganese is added instead of chromium , beryl becomes pink morganite . With iron, it becomes aquamarine. Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.",

        "section": "Siderophile elements",
        "text": "Siderophile (from sideron , \"iron\", and phileo , \"love\") elements are the transition metals which tend to sink into the core because they dissolve readily in iron either as solid solutions or in the molten state, although some sources [3] include elements which are not transition metals in their list of siderophiles, such as germanium . Other sources may also differ in their list based on the temperature being discussed – niobium , vanadium , chromium , and manganese may be considered siderophiles or not, depending on the assumed temperature and pressure. [4] Also confusing the issue is that some elements, such as the aforementioned manganese , as well as molybdenum , form strong bonds with oxygen, but in the free state (as they existed on the primitive Earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust, as do true lithophile elements. Iron , meanwhile, is simply everywhere . The siderophile elements include the highly siderophilic ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , rhenium , osmium , iridium , platinum , and gold , the moderately siderophilic cobalt and nickel , in addition to the \"disputed\" elements mentioned earlier – some sources [3] even include tungsten and silver . [5] Most siderophile elements have practically no affinity whatsoever for oxygen: indeed oxides of gold are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements. They form stronger bonds with carbon or sulfur , but even these are not strong enough to separate out with the chalcophile elements. Thus, siderophile elements are bound through metallic bonds with iron in the dense layer of the Earth's core, where pressures may be high enough to keep the iron solid. Manganese, iron, and molybdenum do form strong bonds with oxygen, but in the free state (as they existed on the primitive Earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust, as do true lithophile elements. However, ores of manganese are found in much the same sites as are those of aluminium and titanium, owing to manganese's great reactivity towards oxygen. Because they are so concentrated in the dense core, siderophile elements are known for their rarity in the Earth's crust. Most of them have always been known as precious metals because of this. Iridium is the rarest transition metal occurring within the Earth's crust, with an abundance by mass of less than one part per billion. Mineable deposits of precious metals usually form as a result of the erosion of ultramafic rocks , but are not highly concentrated even compared to their crustal abundances , which are typically several orders of magnitude below their solar abundances. However, because they are concentrated in the Earth's mantle and core , siderophile elements are believed to be present in the Earth as a whole (including the core) in something approaching their solar abundances.",

        "text": "The acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic , since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly bound planes, but are slower to travel from one plane to another. Graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high temperature material processing applications. However, in oxygen-containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form carbon dioxide at temperatures of 700 °C and above. [29] Graphite is an electrical conductor , hence useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes . It can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity ). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite [30] allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones . Graphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. There is a common belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. [31] However, it has been shown that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space ), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions. [32] This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. [33] Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. [ citation needed ] The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel , [34] [35] and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, [36] and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. [37] Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. [38] Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride , has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called white graphite , due to its similar properties. When a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite . It is also highly anisotropic, and diamagnetic , thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. ([However] If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000–1300 °C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood-contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon , and is not diamagnetic. Pyrolytic graphite and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials. [39] ) Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural materials, due to their shear-planes, brittleness, and inconsistent mechanical properties.",

It stems from γράφειν (\"graphein\") , meaning to write or draw in Ancient Greek . [9] [58] From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. [59] [60] It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead , whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing , typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th-century works, mostly portraits. Today, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite. Around 7% of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils. [61] Low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China. [51] In art, graphite is typically used to create detailed and precise drawings, as it allows for a wide range of values (light to dark) to be achieved. It can also be used to create softer, more subtle lines and shading. Graphite is popular among artists because it is easy to control, easy to erase, and produces a clean, professional look. It is also relatively inexpensive and widely available. Many artists use graphite in conjunction with other media, such as charcoal or ink, to create a range of effects and textures in their work. [62] Graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium . [63]",

        "text": "Graphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation . This may be carried out by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and \"marks\" (coats) the particles of gangue . This makes the \"marked\" gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue). In milling, the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, and then the carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), world production of natural graphite in 2016 was 1,200,000 tonnes , of which the following major exporters are: China (780,000 t), India (170,000 t), Brazil (80,000 t), Turkey (32,000 t) and North Korea (6,000 t). [79] Graphite is not currently mined in the United States , but there are many historical mine sites including ones in Alabama, Montana, and in the Adirondacks of NY. [80] Westwater Resources is in the development stages of creating a pilot plant for their Coosa Graphite Mine near Sylacauga, Alabama . [81] U.S. production of synthetic graphite in 2010 was 134,000 t valued at $1.07 billion. [51]",

        "text": "Globally, over 60,000 patent families in graphite technologies were filed from 2012 to 2021. Patents were filed by applicants from over 60 countries and regions. However, graphite-related patent families originated predominantly from just a few countries. China was the top contributor with more than 47,000 patent families, accounting for four in every five graphite patent families filed worldwide in the last decade. Among other leading countries were Japan , the Republic of Korea , the United States and the Russian Federation . Together, these top five countries of applicant origin accounted for 95 percent of global patenting output related to graphite. [83] Among the different graphite sources, flake graphite has the highest number of patent families, with more than 5,600 filed worldwide from 2012 to 2021. Supported by active research from its commercial entities and research institutions, China is the country most actively exploiting flake graphite and has contributed to 85 percent of global patent filings in this area. At the same time, innovations exploring new synthesis methods and uses for artificial graphite are gaining interest worldwide, as countries seek to exploit the superior material qualities associated with this man-made substance and reduce reliance on the natural material. Patenting activity is strongly led by commercial entities, particularly world-renowned battery manufacturers and anode material suppliers, with patenting interest focused on battery anode applications. [83] The exfoliation process for bulk graphite, which involves separating the carbon layers within graphite, has been extensively studied between 2012 and 2021. Specifically, ultrasonic and thermal exfoliation have been the two most popular approaches worldwide, with 4,267 and 2,579 patent families, respectively, significantly more than for either the chemical or electrochemical alternatives. Global patenting activity relating to ultrasonic exfoliation has decreased over the years, indicating that this low-cost technique has become well established. Thermal exfoliation is a more recent process. Compared to ultrasonic exfoliation, this fast and solvent-free thermal approach has attracted greater commercial interest. [83] As the most widespread anode material for lithium-ion batteries , graphite has drawn significant attention worldwide for use in battery applications. With over 8,000 patent families filed from 2012 to 2021, battery applications were a key driver of global graphite-related inventions. Innovations in this area are led by battery manufacturers or anode suppliers who have amassed sizable patent portfolios focused strongly on battery performance improvements based on graphite anode innovation. Besides industry players, academia and research institutions – Chinese universities, in particular – have been an essential source of innovation in graphite anode technologies. Graphite for polymer applications was an innovation hot topic from 2012 to 2021, with over 8,000 patent families recorded worldwide. However, in recent years, in the top countries of applicant origin in this area, including China, Japan and the United States of America (US), patent filings have decreased. [83] Graphite for manufacturing ceramics represents another area of intensive research, with over 6,000 patent families registered in the last decade alone. Specifically, graphite for refractory accounted for over one-third of ceramics-related graphite patent families in China and about one-fifth in the rest of the world. Other important graphite applications include high-value ceramic materials such as carbides for specific industries, ranging from electrical and electronics, aerospace and precision engineering to military and nuclear applications . Carbon brushes represent a long-explored graphite application area. There have been few inventions in this area over the last decade, with less than 300 patent families filed from 2012 to 2021, very significantly less than between 1992 and 2011. Biomedical , sensor , and conductive ink are emerging application areas for graphite that have attracted interest from both academia and commercial entities, including renowned universities and multinational corporations. Typically for an emerging technology area, related patent families were filed by various organizations without any players dominating. As a result, the top applicants have a small number of inventions , unlike in well-explored areas, where they will have strong technology accumulation and large patent portfolios. The innovation focus of these three emerging areas is highly scattered and can be diverse, even for a single applicant. However, recent inventions are seen to leverage the development of graphite nanomaterials , particularly graphite nanocomposites and graphene . [83]",

The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramid-like rhombohedrons at each end. In nature, quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive . [22] [23] Well-formed crystals typically form as a druse (a layer of crystals lining a void), of which quartz geodes are particularly fine examples. [24] The crystals are attached at one end to the enclosing rock, and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance, within gypsum . [25] α-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, space group P 3 1 21 or P 3 2 21 (space group 152 or 154 resp.) depending on the chirality. Above 573 °C (846 K; 1,063 °F), α-quartz in P 3 1 21 becomes the more symmetric hexagonal P 6 4 22 (space group 181), and α-quartz in P 3 2 21 goes to space group P 6 2 22 (no. 180). [26] These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both α-quartz and β-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO 4 tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between α- and β-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without a change in the way they are linked. [22] [27] However, there is a significant change in volume during this transition, [ clarification needed ] and this can result in significant microfracturing in ceramics [28] and in rocks of the Earth's crust.

The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite .

[67] Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority is the result of heat-treating amethyst or smoky quartz. [66] Carnelian has been heat-treated to deepen its color since prehistoric times.

        "text": "Zeolites are white solids with ordinary handling properties, like many routine aluminosilicate minerals, e.g. feldspar . They have the general formula (MAlO 2 )(SiO 2 ) x (H 2 O) y where M + is usually H + and Na + . The Si/Al ratio is variable, which provides a means to tune the properties. Zeolites with a Si/Al ratios higher than about 3 are classified as high-silica zeolites , which tend to be more hydrophobic. The H + and Na + can be replaced by diverse cations, because zeolites have ion exchange properties. The nature of the cations influences the porosity of zeolites. Zeolites have microporous structures with a typical diameter of 0.3–0.8 nm. Like most aluminosilicates, the framework is formed by linking of aluminum and silicon atoms by oxides. This linking leads to a 3-dimensional network of Si-O-Al, Si-O-Si, and Al-O-Al linkages. The aluminum centers are negatively charged, which requires an accompanying cation. These cations are hydrated during the formation of the materials. The hydrated cations interrupt the otherwise dense network of Si-O-Al, Si-O-Si, and Al-O-Al linkage, leading to regular water-filled cavities. Because of the porosity of the zeolite, the water can exit the material through channels. Because of the rigidity of the zeolite framework, the loss of water does not result in collapse of the cavities and channels. This aspect – the ability to generate voids within the solid material – underpins the ability of zeolites to function as catalysts. They possess high physical and chemical stability due to the large covalent bonding contribution. They have excellent hydrophobicity and are suited for adsorption of bulky, hydrophobic molecules such as hydrocarbons. In addition to that, high-silica zeolites are H + exchangeable, unlike natural zeolites, and are used as solid acid catalysts . The acidity is strong enough to protonate hydrocarbons and high-silica zeolites are used in acid catalysis processes such as fluid catalytic cracking in petrochemical industry. [7]",

        "text": "The structures of hundreds of zeolites have been determined. Most do not occur naturally. For each structure, the International Zeolite Association (IZA) gives a three-letter code called framework type code (FTC). [4] For example, the major molecular sieves, 3A, 4A and 5A, are all LTA (Linde Type A). Most commercially available natural zeolites are of the MOR, HEU or ANA-types. An example of the notation of the ring structure of zeolite and other silicate materials is shown in the upper right figure. The middle figure shows a common notation using structural formula . The left figure emphasizes the SiO 4 tetrahedral structure. Connecting oxygen atoms together creates a four-membered ring of oxygen (blue bold line). In fact, such a ring substructure is called four membered ring or simply four-ring . The figure on the right shows a 4-ring with Si atoms connected to each other, which is the most common way to express the topology of the framework. The figure on the right compares the typical framework structures of LTA (left) and FAU (right). Both zeolites share the truncated octahedral structure ( sodalite cage) (purple line). However, the way they are connected (yellow line) is different: in LTA, the four-membered rings of the cage are connected to each other to form a skeleton, while in FAU, the six-membered rings are connected to each other. As a result, the pore entrance of LTA is an 8-ring (0.41 nm [4] ) and belongs to the small pore zeolite , while the pore entrance of FAU is a 12-ring (0.74 nm [4] ) and belongs to the large pore zeolite , respectively. Materials with a 10-ring are called medium pore zeolites , a typical example being ZSM-5 (MFI). Although more than 200 types of zeolites are known, only about 100 types of aluminosilicate are available. In addition, there are only a few types that can be synthesized in industrially feasible way and have sufficient thermal stability to meet the requirements for industrial use. In particular, the FAU (faujasite, USY), * BEA (beta), MOR (high-silica mordenite), MFI (ZSM-5), and FER (high-silica ferrierite) types are called the big five of high silica zeolites, [8] and industrial production methods have been established.",

Additionally, once they are loaded with trapped fission products, the zeolite-waste combination can be hot-pressed into an extremely durable ceramic form, closing the pores and trapping the waste in a solid stone block. This is a waste form factor that greatly reduces its hazard, compared to conventional reprocessing systems. Zeolites are also used in the management of leaks of radioactive materials. For example, in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster , sandbags of zeolite were dropped into the seawater near the power plant to adsorb the radioactive cesium-137 that was present in high levels.

[31] Zeolite-based oxygen concentrator systems are widely used to produce medical-grade oxygen. The zeolite is used as a molecular sieve to create purified oxygen from air using its ability to trap impurities, in a process involving the adsorption of nitrogen, leaving highly purified oxygen and up to 5% argon. The German group Fraunhofer e.V. announced that they had developed a zeolite substance for use in the biogas industry for long-term storage of energy at a density four times greater than water. [32] [ non-primary source needed ] [33] [34] Ultimately, the goal is to store heat both in industrial installations and in small combined heat and power plants such as those used in larger residential buildings. Debbie Meyer Green Bags , a produce storage and preservation product, uses a form of zeolite as its active ingredient. The bags are lined with zeolite to adsorb ethylene , which is intended to slow the ripening process and extend the shelf life of produce stored in the bags. Clinoptilolite has also been added to chicken food: the absorption of water and ammonia by the zeolite made the birds' droppings drier and less odoriferous, hence easier to handle.

As it has the lowest molecular volume of the three main polymorphs, it is generally the primary titanium-bearing phase in most high-pressure metamorphic rocks, chiefly eclogites . Within the igneous environment, rutile is a common accessory mineral in plutonic igneous rocks , though it is also found occasionally in extrusive igneous rocks , particularly those such as kimberlites and lamproites that have deep mantle sources. Anatase and brookite are found in the igneous environment, particularly as products of autogenic alteration during the cooling of plutonic rocks; anatase is also found in placer deposits sourced from primary rutile. The occurrence of large specimen crystals is most common in pegmatites , skarns , and granite greisens . Rutile is found as an accessory mineral in some altered igneous rocks , and in certain gneisses and schists . In groups of acicular crystals it is frequently seen penetrating quartz as in the fléches d'amour from Graubünden , Switzerland .

        "text": "In large enough quantities in beach sands, rutile forms an important constituent of heavy minerals and ore deposits . Miners extract and separate the valuable minerals – e.g., rutile, zircon , and ilmenite . The main uses for rutile are the manufacture of refractory ceramic , as a pigment , and for the production of titanium metal . Finely powdered rutile is a brilliant white pigment and is used in paints , plastics , paper , foods, and other applications that call for a bright white color. Titanium dioxide pigment is the single greatest use of titanium worldwide. Nanoscale particles of rutile are transparent to visible light but are highly effective in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation ( sunscreen ). The UV absorption of nano-sized rutile particles is blue-shifted compared to bulk rutile so that higher-energy UV light is absorbed by the nanoparticles. Hence, they are used in sunscreens to protect against UV-induced skin damage. Small rutile needles present in gems are responsible for an optical phenomenon known as asterism . Asteriated gems are known as \"star\" gems. Star sapphires , star rubies , and other star gems are highly sought after and are generally more valuable than their normal counterparts. Rutile is widely used as a welding electrode covering . It is also used as a part of the ZTR index , which classifies highly weathered sediments.",
