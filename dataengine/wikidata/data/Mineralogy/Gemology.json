Professional gemologists and gemstone buyers use mobile laboratories, which pool all necessary instruments in a travel case. Such so-called travel labs even have their own current supply, which makes them independent from infrastructure. They are also suitable for gemological expeditions. Gemstones are basically categorized based on their crystal structure , specific gravity , refractive index , and other optical properties, such as pleochroism . The physical property of \"hardness\" is defined by the irregular Mohs scale of mineral hardness . Gemologists study these factors while valuing or appraising cut and polished gemstones. Gemological microscopic study of the internal structure is used to determine whether a gem is synthetic or natural by revealing natural fluid inclusions or partially melted exogenous crystals that are evidence of heat treatment to enhance color. The spectroscopic analysis of cut gemstones also allows a gemologist to understand the atomic structure and identify its origin, which is a major factor in valuing a gemstone. For example, a ruby from Burma will have definite internal and optical activity variance from a Thai ruby. When the gemstones are in a rough state, the gemologist studies the external structure; the host rock and mineral association; and natural and polished color. Initially, the stone is identified by its color, refractive index, optical character, specific gravity, and examination of internal characteristics under magnification.",

Any single test is nearly always only indicative. For example: The specific gravity of ruby is 4.00, glass is 3.15–4.20, and cubic zirconia is 5.6–5.9 . So one can easily tell the difference between cubic zirconia and the other two; however, there is overlap between ruby and glass. As with all naturally occurring materials, no two gems are identical. The geological environment they are created in influences the overall process so that although the basics can be identified, the presence of chemical \"impurities\", and substitutions along with structural imperfections create \"individuals\".",

The powdered gem mineral is then melted (or a metallic mixture directly burned in an oxygen flame) the residue of which then drips through a furnace onto a boule. The boule where the corundum or spinel cools down and crystallizes, spins and thus causes the curved striations, which are diagnostic for a lab-created gem: Natural corundum does not show curved striations. Likewise, natural stones, particularly beryl minerals, show small flaws – short planar cracks where the direction of the crystalline orientation in the gem abruptly changes. The natural formation of gemstones tends to layer the minerals in regular crystalline sheets, whereas many synthetically produced gems have an amorphous structure, like glass. Synthetics made by the Verneuil process either do not show flaws at all, or if any flaws are present, show curvy, undulating surfaces rather than flat ones.",

        "section": "Characteristics and classification",
        "text": "The traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the ancient Greeks , begins with a distinction between precious and semi-precious ; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use, the precious stones are emerald , ruby , sapphire and diamond , with all other gemstones being semi-precious. [9] This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are translucent , with fine color in their purest forms (except for the colorless diamond), and very hard with a hardness score of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale . [10] Other stones are classified by their color, translucency , and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values; for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald. [11] Another traditional term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone . Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it suggests certain stones are more valuable than others when this is not reflected in the actual market value, although it would generally be correct if referring to desirability. In modern times gemstones are identified by gemologists , who describe gems and their characteristics using technical terminology specific to the field of gemology . The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its chemical composition . For example, diamonds are made of carbon ( C ) and rubies of aluminium oxide ( Al 2 O 3 ). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their crystal system such as cubic or trigonal or monoclinic . Another term used is habit , the form the gem is usually found in. [12] For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as octahedrons . [13] Gemstones are classified into different groups , species , and varieties . [14] [15] For example, ruby is the red variety of the species corundum , while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), red beryl (red), goshenite (colorless), heliodor (yellow), and morganite (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species beryl . Gems are characterized in terms of their color (hue, tone and saturation), optical phenomena, luster, refractive index , birefringence , dispersion , specific gravity , hardness , cleavage , and fracture . [16] [17] They may exhibit pleochroism or double refraction . They may have luminescence and a distinctive absorption spectrum . Gemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\". [18] Very transparent gems are considered \" first water \", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency. [19] Additionally, material or flaws within a stone may be present as inclusions . [20]",

        "text": "Gemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision). [21] A mnemonic device , the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help describe the factors used to grade a diamond. With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weights depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, the cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. An ideally cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity, and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality. [22] Physical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual optical phenomena within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) [23] and asteria (star effects). Apart from the more generic and commonly used gemstones such as  from diamonds , rubies , sapphires , and emeralds , pearls and opal [24] have also been defined as precious in the jewellery trade. Up to the discoveries of bulk amethyst in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a \"precious stone\" as well, going back to ancient Greece. Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine , peridot and cat's eye ( cymophane ) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious, thus reinforcing the notion that a mineral's rarity may have been implicated in its classification as a precious stone and thus contribute to its value. Today the gemstone trade no longer makes such a distinction. [25] Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand-name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc. Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones. [26] Rare or unusual gemstones, generally understood to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include andalusite , axinite , cassiterite , clinohumite , painite and red beryl . [27] Gemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics in the quality of the stone. These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom from defects, the beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for such stones. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate. [28] In the addition to the aesthetic and adorning/ornamental purpose of gemstones, there are many proponents of energy medicine who also value gemstones on the basis of their alleged healing powers. [29] A gemstone that has been rising in popularity is Cuprian Elbaite Tourmaline which is also called \"Paraiba Tourmaline\". It was first discovered in the late 1980s in Paraíba, Brazil and later in Mozambique and Nigeria. [30] It is famous for its glowing neon blue color. Paraiba Tourmaline has become one of the most popular gemstones in recent times thanks to its color and is considered to be one of the important gemstones after rubies, emeralds, and sapphires according to Gübelin Gemlab. Even though it is a tourmaline, Paraiba Tourmaline is one of the most expensive gemstones. [31]",

The two main classifications are as follows: Stones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as opal , turquoise , variscite , etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color, luster and other surface properties as opposed to internal reflection properties like brilliance. [35] Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape, and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones. [36] Gems that are transparent are normally faceted, a method that shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for faceted stones . The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the optical properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets. [37] Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.",

        "text": "The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. [38] A ruby appears red because it absorbs all other colors of white light while reflecting red. A material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are corundum ) [39] but exhibit different colors because of impurities which absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light depending on their individual compositions. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \" padparadscha sapphire \". [40] This difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called impurities are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected. For example, beryl , which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If manganese is added instead of chromium , beryl becomes pink morganite . With iron, it becomes aquamarine. Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.",

[65] A chemical powder which corresponds to the desired gemstone is passed through this flames. This melts the ingredients which drop on to a plate and solidify into a crystal called a boule .
