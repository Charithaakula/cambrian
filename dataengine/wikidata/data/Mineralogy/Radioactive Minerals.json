The basic themes of uranium ore genesis are host mineralogy, reduction-oxidation potential , and porosity . Uranium is a highly soluble and radioactive heavy metal . It can be easily dissolved, transported and precipitated within groundwater by subtle changes in oxidation conditions. Uranium does not usually form very insoluble mineral species, which is a further factor in the wide variety of geological conditions and places in which uranium mineralization may accumulate. Uranium is an incompatible element within magmas , and as such it tends to become accumulated within highly fractionated and evolved granite melts, particularly alkaline examples. These melts tend to become highly enriched in uranium, thorium and potassium, and may in turn create internal pegmatites or hydrothermal systems into which uranium may dissolve.",

[11] Primary mineralization consists of pitchblende and coffinite, with weathering producing secondary mineralization. Sandstone deposits constitute about 18% of world uranium resources. Orebodies of this type are commonly low to medium grade (0.05â€“0.4% U 3 O 8 ) and individual orebodies are small to medium in size (ranging up to a maximum of 50,000 t U 3 O 8 ). [13] Sandstone hosted uranium deposits are widespread globally and span a broad range of host rock ages.

Uranium mineralised quartz-hematite breccia is related to Palaeoproterozoic granites with uranium contents of up to 100 ppm.

        "section": "Vein deposits",
        "text": "Vein deposits play a special role in the history of uranium: the term \"pitchblende\" (\" pechblende \") originates from German vein deposits when they were mined for silver in the 16th century. Franz Ernst BrÃ¼ckmann made the first mineralogical description of the mineral in 1727, and the vein deposit Jachymov in the Czech Republic became the type locality for uraninite. [21] In 1789 German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered the element uranium in a sample of pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt vein deposit. The first industrial production of uranium was made from the Jachymov deposit, and Marie and Pierre Curie used the tailings of the mine for their discovery of polonium and radium . Vein deposits consist of uranium minerals filling in cavities such as cracks, veins, fractures, breccias, and stockworks associated with steeply dipping fault systems. There are three major subtypes of vein style uranium mineralisation: Intragranitic veins form in the late phase of magmatic activity when hot fluids derived from the magma precipitate uranium on cracks within the newly formed granite. Such mineralisation contributed much to the uranium production of France. Veins hosted by metasedimentary units in the exocontact of granites are the most important sources of uranium mineralisation in central Europe including the world class deposits Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda in Germany (96,000 t uranium content) as well as Pribram (50,000 t uranium content) and Jachymov (~10,000 t uranium content) in the Czech Republic. Also they are closely related to the granites, the mineralization is much younger with a time gap between granite formation and mineralisation of 20 million years. The initial uranium mineralisation consists of quartz, carbonate , fluorite and pitchblende. Remobilisation of uranium occurred at later stages producing polymetal veins containing silver, cobalt , nickel , arsenic and other elements. Large deposits of this type can contain more than 1,000 individual mineralized veins. However, only 5 to 12% of the vein areas carry mineralization and although massive lenses of pitchblende can occur, the overall ore grade is only about 0.1% uranium. [22] [23] The Bohemian Massif contains shear zone hosted uranium deposits with the most important one being Rozna-Olsi in Moravia northwest of Brno . Rozna is currently the only operating uranium mine in central Europe with a total uranium content of 23,000 t and an average grade of 0.24%. The formation of this mineralisation occurred in several stages. After the Variscan orogeny , extension took place and hydrothermal fluids overprinted fine grained materials in shear zones with a sulfide-chlorite alteration. Fluids from the overlying sediments entered the basement mobilising uranium and while uprising on the shear zone, the chlorite-pyrite material caused precipitation of uranium minerals in form of coffinite, pitchblende and U-Zr-silicates. This initial mineralisation event took place at about 277 million to 264 million years. During the Triassic a further mineralisation event took place relocating uranium into quartz-carbonate-uranium veins. [24] Another example of this mineralisation style is the Shinkolobwe deposit in Congo containing about 30,000 t of uranium. [25]",

It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and roughly equal to that of titanium , rhodium , manganese and niobium . It is malleable , ductile , slightly paramagnetic , strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor . [10] [11] Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1Â g/cm 3 , [12] denser than lead (11.3Â g/cm 3 ), [13] but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3Â g/cm 3 ). [14] [15] Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metallic elements (except noble gases ) and their compounds , with reactivity increasing with temperature. [16] Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. [10] When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide . [11] Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry. Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile . Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, uranium-235 most of the time splits into two smaller nuclei , releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in some circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison , absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control). As little as 15Â lb (6.8Â kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb. [17] The nuclear weapon detonated over Hiroshima , called Little Boy , relied on uranium fission. However, the first nuclear bomb (the Gadget used at Trinity ) and the bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki ( Fat Man ) were both plutonium bombs. Uranium metal has three allotropic forms: [18]",

This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1â€“2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum . [20] At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War syndrome ). [17] Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium . [10] Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. [11] Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses . [11] Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. [21] The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter ). During the later stages of World War II , the entire Cold War , and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.

One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20 terajoules of energy (2 Ã— 10 13 joules ), assuming complete fission; as much energy as 1.5Â million kilograms (1,500 tonnes ) of coal . [9] Commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3% uranium-235. [9] The CANDU and Magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel. Fuel used for United States Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium-235 (the exact values are classified ). In a breeder reactor , uranium-238 can also be converted into plutonium-239 through the following reaction: [11] Before (and, occasionally, after) the discovery of radioactivity, uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes, such as uranium glass and in Fiestaware . [23] The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. [24] [25] This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve , black, blue, red and other colors. Uranium was also used in photographic chemicals (especially uranium nitrate as a toner ), [11] in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs, [26] to improve the appearance of dentures , [27] and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool. Uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense \"stains\" in transmission electron microscopy , to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses , isolated cell organelles and macromolecules . The discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of uranium-238 (4.47 Ã— 10 9 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating , including uraniumâ€“thorium dating , uraniumâ€“lead dating and uraniumâ€“uranium dating . Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets in the making of high-energy X-rays. [11]",

        "text": "Some bacteria, such as Shewanella putrefaciens , Geobacter metallireducens and some strains of Burkholderia fungorum , use uranium for their growth and convert U(VI) to U(IV). [69] [70] Recent research suggests that this pathway includes reduction of the soluble U(VI) via an intermediate U(V) pentavalent state. [71] [72] Other organisms, such as the lichen Trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium Citrobacter , can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment. [73] Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water. [29] [74] The proteobacterium Geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water. [75] The mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant. [76] In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli . [77] Plants absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. [29] Dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat. [29]",

[85] There is a significant reserve of uranium in Bakouma , a sub-prefecture in the prefecture of Mbomou in the Central African Republic . [86] Some uranium also originates from dismantled nuclear weapons. [87] For example, in 1993â€“2013 Russia supplied the United States with 15,000 tonnes of low-enriched uranium within the Megatons to Megawatts Program . [88] An additional 4.6Â billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be dissolved in sea water ( Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). [89] [90] There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, [91] but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .

[95] In 2008, Kazakhstan was forecast to increase production and become the world's largest supplier of uranium by 2009; [96] [97] Kazakhstan has dominated the world's uranium market since 2010. In 2021, its share was 45.1%, followed by Namibia (11.9%), Canada (9.7%), Australia (8.7%), Uzbekistan (7.2%), Niger (4.7%), Russia (5.5%), China (3.9%), India (1.3%), Ukraine (0.9%), and South Africa (0.8%), with a world total production of 48,332 tonnes. [78] Most uranium was produced not by conventional undergroundÂ mining of ores (29% of production), but by in situ leaching (66%). [78] [98] In the late 1960s, UN geologists discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia . The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons. [99] The ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years, [84] though some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century. [100] Uranium deposits seem to be log-normal distributed. There is a 300-fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade. [101] In other words, there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available.",

Uranium content is usually referenced to U 3 O 8 , which dates to the days of the Manhattan Project when U 3 O 8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard. [102] Phase relationships in the uranium-oxygen system are complex. The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding oxides are, respectively, uranium dioxide ( UO 2 ) and uranium trioxide ( UO 3 ). [103] Other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide (UO), diuranium pentoxide ( U 2 O 5 ), and uranium peroxide ( UO 4 Â·2H 2 O ) also exist. The most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide ( U 3 O 8 ) and UO 2 . [104] Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions. Triuranium octoxide is (depending on conditions) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature. Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel. [104] At ambient temperatures, UO 2 will gradually convert to U 3 O 8 . Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal. [104]",

[107] Reduction of UF 4 with hydrogen at 1000Â Â°C produces uranium trifluoride ( UF 3 ). Under the right conditions of temperature and pressure, the reaction of solid UF 4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride ( UF 6 ) can form the intermediate fluorides of U 2 F 9 , U 4 F 17 , and UF 5 . [107] At room temperatures, UF 6 has a high vapor pressure , making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope. This compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process: [107] The resulting UF 6 , a white solid, is highly reactive (by fluorination), easily sublimes (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas ), and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist. [107] One method of preparing uranium tetrachloride ( UCl 4 ) is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride. The reduction of UCl 4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ( UCl 3 ) while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine. [107] All uranium chlorides react with water and air. Bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of, respectively, bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding UH 3 to those element's acids.

Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissile uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurized heavy water reactors . Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction . The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a ' critical mass '. To be considered 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. [123] This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To be considered 'depleted', the 235 U concentration should be no more than 0.3%. [124] The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001. [124] The gas centrifuge process, where gaseous uranium hexafluoride ( UF 6 ) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235 UF 6 and 238 UF 6 using high-speed centrifuges , is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. [35] The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project . In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver - zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium-238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). [35] The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. [9] An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers . [125] Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion. [10] The only significant deviation from the 235 U to 238 U ratio in any known natural samples occurs in Oklo , Gabon , where natural nuclear fission reactors consumed some of the 235 U some two billion years ago when the ratio of 235 U to 238 U was more akin to that of low enriched uranium allowing regular (\"light\") water to act as a neutron moderator akin to the process in humanmade light water reactors . The existence of such natural fission reactors which had been theoretically predicted beforehand was proven as the slight deviation of 235 U concentration from the expected values were discovered during uranium enrichment in France. Subsequent investigations to rule out any nefarious human action (such as stealing of 235 U) confirmed the theory by finding isotope ratios of common fission products (or rather their stable daughter nuclides) in line with the values expected for fission but deviating from the values expected for non-fission derived samples of those elements.",

        "text": "Early researchers found that an electric or magnetic field could split radioactive emissions into three types of beams. The rays were given the names alpha , beta , and gamma, in increasing order of their ability to penetrate matter. Alpha decay is observed only in heavier elements of atomic number 52 ( tellurium ) and greater, with the exception of beryllium-8 (which decays to two alpha particles). The other two types of decay are observed in all the elements. Lead, atomic number 82, is the heaviest element to have any isotopes stable (to the limit of measurement) to radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is seen in all isotopes of all elements of atomic number 83 ( bismuth ) or greater. Bismuth-209 , however, is only very slightly radioactive, with a half-life greater than the age of the universe; radioisotopes with extremely long half-lives are considered effectively stable for practical purposes. In analyzing the nature of the decay products, it was obvious from the direction of the electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that alpha particles carried a positive charge, beta particles carried a negative charge, and gamma rays were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles . Passing alpha particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured particles, and ultimately proved that alpha particles are helium nuclei. Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting from decay and cathode rays , were high-speed electrons . Likewise, gamma radiation and X-rays were found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation . The relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined: For example, gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other types of decay, and occurred at about the same time, or afterwards. Gamma decay as a separate phenomenon, with its own half-life (now termed isomeric transition ), was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers , which were in turn created from other types of decay. Although alpha, beta, and gamma radiations were most commonly found, other types of emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after the discovery of the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons ( positron emission ), along with neutrinos (classical beta decay produces antineutrinos).",

        "text": "The radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that change the electronic structure of the atom, which in turn affects the presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process. A small number of nuclides are affected. [39] For example, chemical bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree (in general, less than 1%) depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus. In 7 Be, a difference of 0.9% has been observed between half-lives in metallic and insulating environments. [40] This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic orbitals , which are subject to electron capture in 7 Be because (like all s atomic orbitals in all atoms) they naturally penetrate into the nucleus. In 1992, Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group observed an accelerated Î² âˆ’ decay of 163 Dy 66+ . Although neutral 163 Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized 163 Dy 66+ undergoes Î² âˆ’ decay into the K and L shells to 163 Ho 66+ with a half-life of 47Â days. [41] Rhenium-187 is another spectacular example. 187 Re normally undergoes beta decay to 187 Os with a half-life of 41.6Â Ã—Â 10 9 years, [42] but studies using fully ionised 187 Re atoms (bare nuclei) have found that this can decrease to only 32.9Â years. [43] This is attributed to \" bound-state Î² âˆ’ decay \" of the fully ionised atom â€“ the electron is emitted into the \"K-shell\" ( 1s atomic orbital), which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low-lying bound states are occupied. [44] A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure, the chemical environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields. [45] Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century, studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor (which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay), and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae (which occurred far away so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us), for example, strongly indicate that unperturbed decay rates have been constant (at least to within the limitations of small experimental errors) as a function of time as well. [ citation needed ] Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak dependence on environmental factors. It has been suggested that measurements of decay rates of silicon-32 , manganese-54 , and radium-226 exhibit small seasonal variations (of the order of 0.1%). [46] [47] [48] However, such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic errors, and a subsequent paper [49] has found no evidence for such correlations in seven other isotopes ( 22 Na, 44 Ti, 108 Ag, 121 Sn, 133 Ba, 241 Am, 238 Pu), and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects. The decay of radon-222 was once reported to exhibit large 4% peak-to-peak seasonal variations (see plot), [50] which were proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or the distance from the Sun, but detailed analysis of the experiment's design flaws, along with comparisons to other, much more stringent and systematically controlled, experiments refute this claim.

Workers spend much time in enclosed cabins thus limiting exposure to radiation. Water is extensively used to suppress airborne dust levels. Groundwater is an issue in all types of mining, but in open pit mining, the usual way of dealing with it â€“ i.e. when the target mineral is found below the natural water table â€“ is to lower the water table by pumping off the water. The ground may settle considerably when groundwater is removed and may again move unpredictably when groundwater is allowed to rise again after mining is concluded. Land reclamation after mining takes different routes, depending on the amount of material removed. Due to the high energy density of uranium, it is often sufficient to fill in the former mine with the overburden, but in case of a mass deficit exceeding the height difference between the previous surface level and the natural water table, artificial lakes develop when groundwater removal ceases. If sulfites, sulfides or sulfates are present in the now-exposed rocks acid mine drainage can be a concern for those newly developing bodies of water. Mining companies are now required by law to establish a fund for future reclamation while mining is ongoing and those funds are usually deposited in such a way as to be unaffected by bankruptcy of the mining company.",

        "text": "If the uranium is too far below the surface for open pit mining, an underground mine might be used with tunnels and shafts dug to access and remove uranium ore. Underground uranium mining is in principle no different from any other hard rock mining and other ores are often mined in association (e.g., copper, gold, silver). Once the ore body has been identified a shaft is sunk in the vicinity of the ore veins, and crosscuts are driven horizontally to the veins at various levels, usually every 100 to 150 metres. Similar tunnels, known as drifts, are driven along the ore veins from the crosscut. To extract the ore, the next step is to drive tunnels, known as raises when driven upwards and winzes when driven downward, through the deposit from level to level. Raises are subsequently used to develop the stopes where the ore is mined from the veins. The stope, which is the workshop of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Three methods of stope mining are commonly used. In the \"cut and fill\" or \"open stoping\" method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the \"shrinkage\" method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working from the top of the pile to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. The method known as \"room and pillar\" is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support. The health effects discovered from radon exposure in unventilated uranium mining prompted the switch away from uranium mining via tunnel mining towards open cut and in-situ leaching technology, a method of extraction that does not produce the same occupational hazards, or mine tailings, as conventional mining. With regulations in place to ensure the use of high volume ventilation technology if any confined space uranium mining is occurring, occupational exposure and mining deaths can be largely eliminated. [27] [28] The Olympic Dam and Canadian underground mines are ventilated with powerful fans with radon levels being kept at a very low to practically \"safe level\" in uranium mines. Naturally occurring radon in other, non-uranium mines, also may need control by ventilation. [29]",

Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated. However, the orebody needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located so that they do not contaminate ground water away from the orebody. Uranium ISL uses the native groundwater in the orebody which is fortified with a complexing agent and in most cases an oxidant. It is then pumped through the underground orebody to recover the minerals in it by leaching. Once the pregnant solution is returned to the surface, the uranium is recovered in much the same way as in any other uranium plant (mill). In Australian ISL mines ( Beverley , Four Mile and Honeymoon Mine ) the oxidant used is hydrogen peroxide and the complexing agent sulfuric acid. Kazakh ISL mines generally do not employ an oxidant but use much higher acid concentrations in the circulating solutions. ISL mines in the USA use an alkali leach due to the presence of significant quantities of acid-consuming minerals such as gypsum and limestone in the host aquifers. Any more than a few percent carbonate minerals means that alkali leach must be used in preference to the more efficient acid leach. The Australian government has published a best practice guide for in situ leach mining of uranium, which is being revised to take account of international differences. [31]",

From 1965 to 1967 Union Carbide operated a mill in North Dakota , United States, burning uraniferous lignite and extracting uranium from the ash.

For example, owners of U.S. nuclear power reactors bought 67Â million pounds (30Â kt) of natural uranium in 2006. Out of that 84%, or 56Â million pounds (25Â kt), were imported from foreign suppliers, according to the Energy Department. [111] Because of the improvements in gas centrifuge technology in the 2000s, replacing former gaseous diffusion plants, cheaper separative work units have enabled the economic production of more enriched uranium from a given amount of natural uranium, by re-enriching tails ultimately leaving a depleted uranium tail of lower enrichment. This has somewhat lowered the demand for natural uranium. [110]",

        "text": "Generally speaking, in the case of nuclear energy the cost of  fuel has the lowest share in total energy costs of all fuel consuming energy forms (i.e. Fossil fuels, biomass and nuclear). Furthermore, given the immense energy density of nuclear fuel (particularly in the form of enriched uranium or high grade plutonium), it is easy to stockpile amounts of fuel material to last several years at constant consumption. Power plants that do not have online refuelling capabilities, as is the case for the vast majority of commercial power plants in operation, will refuel as seldom as possible to avoid costly downtime and usually plan refuelling shutdowns long in advance so as to allow maintenance and inspection to use the scheduled downtime as well. As such power plant operators tend to have long-term contracts with fuel suppliers that are â€“ if at all â€“ only minorly affected by the fluctuations of uranium prices. The effect on electricity price for end consumers is negligible even in countries like France, which derive a majority of their electric energy from nuclear power. Nonetheless, short term price developments like the 2007 uranium bubble , can have drastic effects on mining companies, prospection and the economic calculations as to whether a certain deposit is worthwhile for commercial purposes. Since 1981 uranium prices and quantities in the US are reported by the Department of Energy . [114] [115] The import price dropped from 32.90Â US$/lb-U 3 O 8 in 1981 down to 12.55 in 1990 and to below 10Â US$/lb-U 3 O 8 in the year 2000. Prices paid for uranium during the 1970s were higher, 43Â US$/lb-U 3 O 8 is reported as the selling price for Australian uranium in 1978 by the Nuclear Information Centre. Uranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing US$7/lb, but in April 2007 the price of Uranium on the spot market rose to US$113.00/lb, [116] a high point of the uranium bubble of 2007 . This was very close to the all time high (adjusted for inflation) in 1977. [117] Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster , the global uranium sector remained depressed with the uranium price falling more than 50%, declining share values, and reduced profitability of uranium producers since March 2011 and into 2014. As a result, uranium companies worldwide are reducing costs, and limiting operations. [118] [ unreliable source? ] As an example, Westwater Resources (previously Uranium Resources), has had to cease all uranium operations due to unfavorable prices. Since then, Westwater has tried branching out into other markets, namely lithium and graphite . [119] As of July 2014, the price of uranium concentrate remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak spot price in January 2011, reflecting the loss of Japanese demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster . [120] As a result of continued low prices, in February 2014 mining company Cameco deferred plans to expand production from existing Canadian mines, although it continued work to open a new mine at Cigar Lake. [121] Also in February 2014, Paladin energy suspended operations at its mine in Malawi, saying that the high-cost operation was losing money at current prices. [122]",

Charles Steen made a significant discover near Moab, Utah , while Paddy Martinez made another near Grants, New Mexico . However, by the 1960s, the United States, USSR, France and China were reducing their acquisitions of uranium. The United States started enriching only uranium mined within its country, but by 1965, production had dropped by 40 percent. By 1971, in an attempt to stop further reductions in prices, mining executives from UCAN, Nufcor, Rio Tinto, and government representatives agreed to share the market with Canadians getting 33.5 percent, South Africa 23.75 percent, France 21.75 percent, Australia 17 percent, and Rio Tinto Zinc 4 percent. By 1974, this market share agreement ended as uranium prices rose in concert with energy prices due to OPEC boycotts, and the United States ending its trade ban of foreign uranium. [5] :â€Š131â€“135,â€Š144â€“151,â€Š157â€“161,â€Š191â€“196 In Europe a mixed situation exists. Considerable nuclear power capacities have been developed, notably in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. In many countries development of nuclear power has been stopped and phased out by legal actions. In Italy the use of nuclear power was barred by a referendum in 1987; this is now under revision. [134] Ireland in 2008 also had no plans to change its non-nuclear stance . [135] The years 1976 and 1977 saw uranium mining become a major political issue in Australia, with the Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining. [136] The Movement Against Uranium Mining group was formed in 1976, and many protests and demonstrations against uranium mining were held. [136] [137] Concerns relate to the health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining. Notable Australian anti-uranium activists have included Kevin Buzzacott , Jacqui Katona , Yvonne Margarula , and Jillian Marsh . [138] [139] [140] The World Uranium Hearing was held in Salzburg, Austria , in September 1992. Anti-nuclear speakers from all continents, including indigenous speakers and scientists, testified to the health and environmental problems of uranium mining and processing, nuclear power , nuclear weapons , nuclear tests , and radioactive waste disposal . [141] People who spoke at the 1992 hearing include: Thomas Banyacya , Katsumi Furitsu , Manuel Pino and Floyd Red Crow Westerman . They highlighted the threat of radioactive contamination to all peoples, especially indigenous communities, and said that their survival requires self-determination and emphasis on spiritual and cultural values. Increased renewable energy commercialization was advocated. [142] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with the help of China has built an extraction facility to obtain uranium yellowcake from uranium ore. According to Western officials with information regarding the extraction site, the process is conducted by the oil-rich kingdom to champion nuclear technology. However, Saudi Energy Minister denied having built a uranium ore facility and claimed that the extraction of minerals is a fundamental part of the kingdom's strategy to diversify its economy. [143] Despite sanctions on Russia some countries still buy its uranium in 2022, [144] and some argue the EU should stop.

[182] Michael Meacher , the former environment minister of the UK (1997â€“2003), reports that peak uranium happened in 1981. He also predicts a major shortage of uranium sooner than 2013 accompanied with hoarding and its value pushed up to the levels of precious metals. [183] M. C. Day projected in 1975 that uranium reserves could run out as soon as 1989, but, more optimistically, would be exhausted by 2015. [181] Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen , an independent analyst with Ceedata Consulting, contends that supplies of the high-grade uranium ore required to fuel nuclear power generation will, at current levels of consumption, last to about 2034. Afterwards, he expects the cost of energy to extract the uranium will exceed the price the electric power provided. [184] The Energy Watch Group has calculated that, even with steep uranium prices, uranium production will have reached its peak by 2035 and that it will only be possible to satisfy the fuel demand of nuclear plants until then. [185] Various agencies have tried to estimate how long these resources will last.\nThe European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world's energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years. [177] According to the industry groups OECD , NEA and IAEA , the world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of US$130/kg, are enough to last for 100 years at current consumption. [68] According to the Australian Uranium Association , another industry group, assuming the world's current rate of consumption at 66,500 tonnes of uranium per year and the world's present measured resources of uranium (4.7 Mt) are enough to last for 70 years.

        "text": "Only about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or ions , and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being dark matter . The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even less well understood dark energy ). The 94 naturally occurring chemical elements were produced by at least four classes of astrophysical process. Most of the hydrogen, helium and a very small quantity of lithium were produced in the first few minutes of the Big Bang . This Big Bang nucleosynthesis happened only once; the other processes are ongoing. Nuclear fusion inside stars produces elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, including all elements from carbon to iron in atomic number. Elements higher in atomic number than iron, including heavy elements like uranium and plutonium, are produced by various forms of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae and neutron star mergers . The light elements lithium , beryllium and boron are produced mostly through cosmic ray spallation (fragmentation induced by cosmic rays ) of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. During the early phases of the Big Bang, nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 ( protium , 1 H) and helium-4 ( 4 He), as well as a smaller amount of deuterium ( 2 H) and very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10 âˆ’10 ) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very old stars, while carbon has not. [22] No elements heavier than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% 1 H, 25% 4 He, and 0.01% deuterium, with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and perhaps boron. [23] Subsequent enrichment of galactic halos occurred due to stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis . [24] However, the element abundance in intergalactic space can still closely resemble primordial conditions, unless it has been enriched by some means. On Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of nuclear transmutation processes. These include some produced by cosmic rays or other nuclear reactions (see cosmogenic and nucleogenic nuclides), and others produced as decay products of long-lived primordial nuclides. [25] For example, trace (but detectable) amounts of carbon-14 ( 14 C) are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting nitrogen atoms, and argon-40 ( 40 Ar) is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium-40 ( 40 K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive actinides, thorium, uranium, and plutonium, decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and radon , which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds. Three other radioactive elements, technetium, promethium, and neptunium, occur only incidentally in natural materials, produced as individual atoms by nuclear fission of the nuclei of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes. In addition to the 94 naturally occurring elements, several artificial elements have been produced by human nuclear physics technology. As of 2021 [update] , these experiments have produced all elements up to atomic number 118.",

        "text": "The following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our Solar System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million , by mass . [26] Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the visible universe , however, scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance. The abundance of elements in the Solar System is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang and a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays). Beginning with carbon, elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovas . Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with their atomic number. The abundance of the chemical elements on Earth varies from air to crust to ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust differs from that in the Solar System (as seen in the Sun and heavy planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon (as hydrocarbons), nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system. Oxygen, the most abundant Earth element by mass, is retained on Earth by combination with silicon. Aluminium at 8% by mass is more common in the Earth's crust than in the universe and solar system, but the composition of the far more bulky mantle, which has magnesium and iron in place of aluminium (which occurs there only at 2% of mass) more closely mirrors the elemental composition of the solar system, save for the noted loss of volatile elements to space, and loss of iron which has migrated to the Earth's core. The composition of the human body , by contrast, more closely follows the composition of seawater â€”save that the human body has additional stores of carbon and nitrogen necessary to form the proteins and nucleic acids , together with phosphorus in the nucleic acids and energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that occurs in the cells of all living organisms. Certain kinds of organisms require particular additional elements, for example the magnesium in chlorophyll in green plants, the calcium in mollusc shells , or the iron in the hemoglobin in vertebrate animals ' red blood cells .",

Additionally, elements may exist in different isotopes , with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide . Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo radioactive decay and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including alpha decay (emission of alpha particles ) and beta decay ( electron emission, positron emission, or electron capture ). Another possibility is spontaneous fission into two or more nuclides. [ citation needed ] While the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays exponentially at a rate described by a parameter known as the half-life , usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a \"daughter\" nuclide or decay product . In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a decay chain , eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., tritium ) to over 100 billion years (e.g., samarium-147 ). [4] For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially constant. [5] This is known because decay constants measured by different techniques give consistent values within analytical errors and the ages of the same materials are consistent from one method to another. It is not affected by external factors such as temperature , pressure , chemical environment, or presence of a magnetic or electric field . [6] [7] [8] The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as beryllium-7 , strontium-85 , and zirconium-89 , whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. [ citation needed ] This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a clock to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.",

        "section": "Accuracy of radiometric dating",
        "text": "The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration . [10] Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an isochron . This can reduce the problem of contamination . In uraniumâ€“lead dating , the concordia diagram is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland was determined to be 3.60 Â± 0.05 Ga (billion years ago) using uraniumâ€“lead dating and 3.56 Â± 0.10 Ga (billion years ago) using leadâ€“lead dating, results that are consistent with each other. [11] :â€Š142â€“143 Accurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under \"Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides\"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves isotope-ratio mass spectrometry . [12] The precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades. [13]",

This scheme has been refined to the point that the error margin in dates of rocks can be as low as less than two million years in two-and-a-half billion years. [20] [21] An error margin of 2â€“5% has been achieved on younger Mesozoic rocks. [22] Uraniumâ€“lead dating is often performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO 4 ), though it can be used on other materials, such as baddeleyite and monazite (see: monazite geochronology ). [23] Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for zirconium , but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. In situ micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser ICP-MS or SIMS techniques. [24] One of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost.

Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of 5,730 years [28] [29] (which is very short compared with the above isotopes), and decays into nitrogen. [30] In other radiometric dating methods, the heavy parent isotopes were produced by nucleosynthesis in supernovas, meaning that any parent isotope with a short half-life should be extinct by now. Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by cosmic rays with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). [ citation needed ] A carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through photosynthesis , and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years. [31] The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of volcanoes or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the biosphere as a consequence of industrialization have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; in contrast, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground nuclear bomb tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the solar wind or the Earth's magnetic field above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere. [ citation needed ]",

The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with slow neutrons . This causes induced fission of 235 U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of 238 U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the neutron flux . [ citation needed ] This scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years micas , tektites (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using zircon , apatite , titanite , epidote and garnet which have a variable amount of uranium content. [32] Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200Â Â°C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit. [33]",

        "section": "Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell",
        "text": "The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle . High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud . This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature. [ citation needed ] For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements. In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4. [ citation needed ] The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically : it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang , as the \"soup\" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. Owing to the relatively tight binding of helium-4 nuclei, its production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and thus few neutrons were available to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy ) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. [89] It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon , carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple-alpha process ). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4. All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matterâ€”nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen. [ citation needed ]",

        "text": "Helium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon , and thus the second least reactive of all elements. [90] It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity , specific heat , and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen . For these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen. [29] Helium is the least water- soluble monatomic gas, [91] and one of the least water-soluble of any gas ( CF 4 , SF 6 , and C 4 F 8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x 2 /10 âˆ’5 , respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x 2 /10 âˆ’5 ), [92] and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. [93] Helium has a negative Jouleâ€“Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Jouleâ€“Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50Â K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. [29] Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling. Most extraterrestrial helium is plasma in stars, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere , giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora . [94]",

        "text": "Liquid helium below its lambda point (called heliumÂ II ) exhibits very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity , when it boils, it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about the properties of the isotope. [29] HeliumÂ II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10 to 100 nm it has no measurable viscosity . [27] However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Existing theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state , which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid. [96] In the fountain effect , a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of heliumÂ II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container. [97] The thermal conductivity of heliumÂ II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumÂ I and several hundred times that of copper . [29] This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumÂ II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8Â K through heliumÂ II as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound . [29] HeliumÂ II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of heliumÂ II, the heliumÂ II moves along the surface, against the force of gravity . HeliumÂ II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30Â nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin . [29] [98] [99] As a result of this creeping behavior and heliumÂ II's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, it is very difficult to confine. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumÂ II will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force . [100] These waves are known as third sound . [101]",

        "text": "Helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions. [103] It is an electrical insulator unless ionized . As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential . [29] Helium can form unstable compounds , known as excimers , with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge , to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe 10 , and WHe 2 , and the molecular ions He + 2 , He 2+ 2 , HeH + , and HeD + have been created this way. [118] HeH + is also stable in its ground state but is extremely reactiveâ€”it is the strongest BrÃ¸nsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He 2 , which has a large number of band systems , and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces. [29] Van der Waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance, such as LiHe and He 2 . [119] Theoretically, other true compounds may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF), which would be analogous to HArF , discovered in 2000. [120] Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. [121] Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH 3 ) 4 FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO âˆ’ anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon . [122] Helium atoms have been inserted into the hollow carbon cage molecules (the fullerenes ) by heating under high pressure. The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside. [123] If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . [124] Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds. Under high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N 2 ) 11 ) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell . [125] The insulating electride Na 2 He has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure. [126]",

The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device ( helium mass spectrometer ), even at the leak rates as small as 10 âˆ’9 mbarÂ·L/s (10 âˆ’10 PaÂ·m 3 /s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device. [163] Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material.
