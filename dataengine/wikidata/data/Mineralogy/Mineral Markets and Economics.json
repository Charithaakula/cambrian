        "text": "In 2020, the total value of assets of the banking sector in Turkey amounted to more than $800 billion. [113] As of January 2021, there were a total of 48 banks operating with 9,880 branches in Turkey and 71 branches abroad. [114] As of October 2021 [update] , the foreign currency deposits of the citizens and residents in Turkish banks stood at $234 billion, equivalent to around half of all deposits. [115] [116] As of March 2023 [update] , the foreign currency reserves of the Turkish Central Bank were $62.6 billion (a 2.3% increase compared to the previous month), its gold reserves were $52.2 billion (a 7.2% increase compared to the previous month), while its official reserve assets stood at $122.4 billion (a 4.3% increase compared to the previous month). [117] The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey ( Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası ) was founded in 1930, as a privileged joint-stock company. The CBRT possesses the sole right to issue notes. It also has the obligation to provide for the monetary requirements of the state agricultural and commercial enterprises. Originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange ( Dersaadet Tahvilat Borsası ) in 1866, and reorganized to its current structure at the beginning of 1986, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) is the sole securities market of Turkey. [118] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Istanbul was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire , where the headquarters of the Ottoman Central Bank (established as the Bank-ı Osmanî in 1856, and later reorganized as the Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane in 1863) [119] and the Ottoman Stock Exchange (1866) were located. [120] Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak . [120] In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange moved to its current building in the Istinye quarter. [121] The Istanbul Gold Exchange was also established in 1995. The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Turkey was valued at $161,537,000,000 in 2005 by the World Bank . [122] Government regulations passed in 1929 required all insurance companies to reinsure 30% of each policy with the Millî Reasürans T.A.Ş. (National Reinsurance Corporation) which was founded on 26 February 1929. [123] In 1954, life insurance was exempted from this requirement. The insurance market is officially regulated through the Ministry of Commerce. [ citation needed ] Until 1991, establishing a private sector bank in Turkey was subject to strict government controls and regulations. On 10 October 1991 (ten days before the general elections of 20 October 1991) the ANAP government of Prime Minister Mesut Yılmaz gave special permissions to five prominent businessmen (who had close links to the government) to establish their own small-scale private banks. [ citation needed ] These were Kentbank (owned by the Süzer Group), Park Yatırım Bankası (owned by Karamehmet), Toprakbank (owned by Toprak), Bank Ekspres (owned by Betil), and Alternatif Bank (owned by Doğan.) They were followed by other small-scale private banks established between 1994 and 1995, during the DYP government of Prime Minister Tansu Çiller , who introduced drastic changes to the banking laws and regulations which made it easier to establish a bank in Turkey, but also opened many loopholes in the system. [ citation needed ] In 1998 there were 72 banks in Turkey , many of which were owned by businessmen who used them for financing the investments of their own companies in diverse sectors, such as contracting, textiles and media. [ citation needed ] As a result, in 1999 and 2001 , the DSP government of Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit had to face two major economic crises that were caused mostly by the weak and loosely regulated banking sector, the growing trade deficit, and the devastating İzmit earthquake of 17 August 1999. [ citation needed ] The Turkish lira , which was pegged to the U.S. dollar prior to the crisis of 2001, had to be floated, and lost an important amount of its value. This financial breakdown reduced the number of banks to 31. Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit had to call the renowned economist Kemal Derviş to tidy up the economy and especially the weak banking system so that a similar economic crisis would not happen again. [ citation needed ] More than 34% of the assets in the Turkish banking sector are concentrated in the Agricultural Bank ( Ziraat Bankası ), Housing Bank ( Yapı Kredi Bankası ), Isbank ( Türkiye İş Bankası ) and Akbank. [ citation needed ] The five big state-owned banks were restructured in 2001. Political involvement was minimized and loaning policies were changed. There are also numerous international banks , which have branches in Turkey. A number of Arabian trading banks, whith Islamic banking practices, are also present in the country. [ citation needed ] After years of low levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), in 2007 Turkey succeeded in attracting $21.9 billion in FDI and is expected to attract a higher figure in following years. [127] A series of large privatizations, the stability fostered by the start of Turkey's EU accession negotiations , strong and stable growth, and structural changes in the banking, retail, and telecommunications sectors have all contributed to the rise in foreign investment. [ citation needed ] At present, the Turkish banking sector is among the strongest and most expansive in East Europe , the Middle East and Central Asia . [ citation needed ] Between 2001 and 2008, the Turkish lira maintained its stability, becoming an internationally exchangeable currency again, in line with the inflation that had dropped to single-digit figures during this period. The \"New Turkish lira \" (TRY) was introduced on 1 January 2005. [128] For a few days in March 2006, 1 New Turkish lira was slightly more valuable than 1 Swiss franc (1 CHF = 0.994 TRY on March 1, 2006), [129] maintaining a close balance with the value of the Swiss franc until the end of December 2007. [130] On 1 January 2009, the New Turkish lira was renamed once again as the \"Turkish lira\", with the introduction of new banknotes and coins . Fiscal deficit benefitted (though in a small amount) from large industrial privatizations. Banking came under stress beginning in October 2008, as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis . Turkish banking authorities warned state-run banks against the pullback of loans from the larger financial sectors. [131] Turkey's economy resumed its growth between 2009 and 2013, which was followed by a period of stagnation and recession between 2014 and 2020. Turkey's GDP began to recover and grow again in the period between 2020 and 2023.",

[152] In addition to the European-Turkish Customs Union, the Turkish government has signed free-trade agreements with 22 countries. [153] A very large aspect of Turkey trade revolves around the automotive industry, where its top exports are cars, accounting for $13.2 billion. Other top exports from the country are gold, delivery trucks, vehicle parts and jewelry, which are respectively, $6.96 billion, $5.04 billion, $4.64 billion, and $3.39 billion. These values are calculated using the 1992 revision of the Harmonized System classification. Comparatively, it imports many of the same industries, such as, gold valued at $17.1 billion, refined petroleum at $9.8 billion, cars at $8.78 billion, vehicle parts at $6.34 billion and scrap iron at $5.84 billion. [154] Turkey is also a source of foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe and the CIS , with more than $1.5 billion invested. 32% has been invested in Russia , primarily in the natural resources and construction sector, and 46% in Turkey's Black Sea neighbours, Bulgaria and Romania . Turkish companies also have sizable FDI stocks in Poland , at about $100 million.

        "text": "Despite the mitigation of the severe drought that plagued the region in the late 1990s and the recovery of energy export revenues, Syria's economy has historically faced serious challenges. Commerce has always been important to the Syrian economy, [48] which benefited from the country's strategic location along major east–west trade routes . Syrian cities boast both traditional industries such as weaving and dried-fruit packing and modern heavy industry . Given the policies adopted from the 1960s through the late 1980s, Syria refused to join the \" global economy \". In late 2001, however, Syria submitted a request to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to begin the accession process. Syria had been an original contracting party of the former General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but withdrew in 1951 because of Israel's joining. Major elements of current Syrian trade rules would have to change in order to be consistent with the WTO. In March 2007, Syria signed an Association Agreement with the European Union that would encourage both sides to negotiate a free trade agreement before 2010. The bulk of Syrian imports have been raw materials essential for industry, agriculture, equipment, and machinery. Major exports include crude oil , refined products, raw cotton , clothing , fruits, and cereal grains. Over time, the government has increased the number of transactions to which the more favorable neighboring country exchange rate applies. The government also introduced a quasi-rate for non-commercial transactions in 2001 broadly in line with prevailing black market rates. Given the poor development of its own capital markets and Syria's lack of access to international money and capital markets, monetary policy remains captive to the need to cover the fiscal deficit . Although in 2003 Syria lowered interest rates for the first time in 22 years and again in 2004, rates remain fixed by law. As of 2012 [update] , because of the ongoing Syrian civil war, the value of Syria's overall exports has been slashed by two-thirds, from the figure of US$12 billion in 2010 to only US$4 billion in 2012. [49] Syria's GDP declined by over 3% in 2011. [50]",

        "text": "Agriculture is a high priority in Syria's economic development plans, as the government seeks to achieve food self-sufficiency, increase export earnings, and halt rural out-migration. [55] Thanks to sustained capital investment , infrastructure development, subsidies of inputs, and price supports, before the civil war Syria went from a net importer of many agricultural products to an exporter of cotton, fruits, vegetables , and other foodstuffs. One of the prime reasons for this turnaround was the government's investment in huge irrigation systems in northern and northeastern Syria. [56] The agriculture sector, as of 2009, employed about 17% of the labor force and generates about 21% of the gross domestic product, [57] [58] of which livestock accounted for 16% and fruit and grains for more than 40%. [55] In 2015, Syria's main exports included spice seeds ($83.2 million), apples and pears ($53.2 million). [59] Most land is privately owned, a crucial factor behind the sector's success. [55] Of Syria's 196,000 km 2 (76,000 sq mi), [56] about 28% of it is cultivated, and 21% of that total is irrigated. Most irrigated land is designated \"strategic\", meaning that it encounters significant state intervention in terms of pricing, subsidies, and marketing controls. \"Strategic\" products such as wheat, barley, and sugar beets, must be sold to state marketing boards at fixed prices, often above world prices in order to support farmers, but at a significant cost to the state budget. The most widely grown arable crop is wheat, but the most important cash crop is cotton; cotton was the largest single export before the development of the oil sector. Nevertheless, the total area planted with cotton has declined because of an increasing problem of water shortage coupled with old and inefficient irrigation techniques. The output of grains like wheat is often underutilized because of poor storage facilities. [55] Water and energy are among the most pervasive issues facing the agriculture sector. Another difficulty suffered by the agricultural sector is the government's decision to liberalize prices of fertilizers, which increased between 100% and 400%. [ when? ] Drought was an alarming problem in 2008; however, the drought situation slightly improved in 2009. Wheat and barley production about doubled in 2009 compared to 2008. In spite of that, the livelihoods of up to 1 million agricultural workers have been threatened. In response, the UN launched an emergency appeal for $20.2 million. Wheat has been one of the crops most affected, and for the first time in 2 decades Syria has moved from being a net exporter of wheat to a net importer. [60] During the civil war which began in 2011, the Syrian government was forced to put out a tender for 100,000 metric tonnes of wheat, one of the few trade products not subject to economic sanctions. [61] Less than 2.7% of Syria's land area is forested , and only a portion of that is commercially useful. [14] Limited forestry activity is centered in the higher elevations of the mountains just inland from the coast, where rainfall is more abundant. [62]",

        "text": "The Central Bank of Syria began operations in 1959. It controls all foreign exchange and trade transactions and gives priority to lending to the public sector . The Central Bank has been subject to US sanctions since May 2004, which has accused the Bank of money laundering . [73] These US sanctions may have increased the role of Lebanese and European banks because a ban on transactions between U.S. financial institutions and the Central Bank of Syria created an increase in demand for intermediary sources for US$ transfers. [ needs update ] [58] The United States, European Union, Arab League and Turkey all also imposed sanctions on the Central Bank because of the Civil War. [74] [75] The six specialized state-owned banks – the Central Bank of Syria, Commercial Bank of Syria , Agricultural Co-Operative Bank, Industrial Bank , Popular Credit Bank, and Real Estate Bank – are major financial operators. They each extend funds to, and take deposits from, a particular sector. The Industrial Bank also is directed more toward the public sector, although it is under-capitalized . As a result, the private sector often is forced to bank abroad, a process that is more expensive and therefore a poor solution to industrial financing needs. Many business people travel abroad to deposit or borrow funds. It is estimated that Syrians have deposited US$6 billion in Lebanese banks. In the 2000s, Syria started reforms in the financial sector , including the introduction of private banks and the opening of the Damascus Securities Exchange in March 2009. [76] In 2001, Syria legalized private banks and the sector, while still nascent, has been growing. [24] Foreign banks were given licenses in December 2002, under Law 28 March 2001 which allows the establishment of private and joint-venture banks. Foreigners are allowed up to 49% ownership of a bank, but may not hold a controlling stake. [58] As of January 2010, 13 private banks had opened, including two Islamic banks . Syria took gradual steps to loosen controls over foreign exchange . In 2003, the government canceled a law that criminalized private sector use of foreign currencies, and in 2005 it allowed licensed private banks to sell specific amounts of foreign currency to Syrian citizens under certain circumstances and to the private sector to finance imports. In October 2009, Syria further loosened its restrictions on currency transfers by allowing Syrians travelling abroad to withdraw the equivalent of up to US$10,000 from their Syrian pound accounts. In practice, the decision allows local banks to open accounts of a maximum of US$10,000 that their clients can use for their international payment cards . The holders of these accounts will be able to withdraw up to US$10,000 per month while travelling abroad. [24] To attract investment and to ease access to credit, the government allowed investors in 2007 to receive loans and other credit instruments from foreign banks, and to repay the loans and any accrued interest through local banks using project proceeds. In February 2008, the government permitted investors to receive loans in foreign currencies from local private banks to finance capital investments . Syria's exchange rate is fixed, and the government maintains two official rates—one rate on which the budget and the value of imports, customs, and other official transactions are based, and a second set by the Central Bank on a daily basis that covers all other financial transactions . The government passed a law in 2006 which permits the operation of private money exchange companies. However, there is still a small black market for foreign currency. [24] Since the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, there has been a capital flight to nearby countries. Syria has been subject to sanctions by United States, Canada, European Union, Arab League and Turkey because of the civil war. [77] [78] [79] The currency of Syria is the Syrian pound (SYP). The pound's official exchange rate has deteriorated significantly, falling from £S 47 for US$1 before the civil war to £S 1,256 as in June 2020. [80] [81] On another hand, while its exchange rate for money transfer is £S 1,250 for US$1, [81] its non-official exchange rate (black market) plunged to around £S 4,000 for US$1 in March 2021.

        "text": "Indonesia was the only South East Asian member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) until its suspension in 2009. The country currently remains a net oil importer despite its large petroleum production industry. [80] In 1999, crude and condensate output averaged 1.5 million barrels (240,000 m 3 ) per day, and in 1998, the oil and gas sector including refining, contributed approximately 9% to GDP. As of 2005, crude oil and condensate output were 1.07 million barrels (170,000 m 3 ) per day. It indicates a substantial decline from the 1990s, due primarily to ageing oil fields and a lack of investment in oil production equipment. This decline in production has been accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic consumption, about 5.4% per year, leading to an estimated US$1.2 billion cost for importing oil in 2005. The state owns all petroleum and mineral rights. Foreign firms participate through production-sharing and work contracts. Oil and gas contractors are required to finance all exploration, production, and development costs in their contract areas and are entitled to recover operating, exploration, and development costs out of the oil and gas produced. Indonesia had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing US$7 billion in 2004. [81] SBY has mandated a significant reduction of government subsidy of fuel prices in several stages. [82] The government has stated that cuts in subsidies are aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 1% of GDP in 2005, down from around 1.6% last year. At the same time, the government has offered one-time subsidies for qualified citizens, to alleviate hardships. Indonesia is the world's largest tin market. Although mineral production traditionally centered on bauxite, silver, and tin, it is expanding its copper, nickel, gold, and coal output for export markets. In mid-1993, the Department of Mines and Energy reopened the coal sector to foreign investment, resulting in a joint venture between Indonesian coal producer and BP and Rio Tinto Group . Total coal production reached 74 million metric tons in 1999, including exports of 55 million tons, and in 2011, production was 353 million. As of 2014, Indonesia is the third-largest producer with a total output of 458 Mt and export of 382 Mt. [83] At this rate, the reserves will be used up in 61 years until 2075. [84] Not all of the productions can be exported due to Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) regulation, which should fulfill the domestic market. In 2012, the DMO was 24.72%. Starting from 2014, no low-grade coal exports are allowed, so the upgraded brown coal process that cranks up the calorie value of coal from 4,500 to 6,100 kcal/kg will be built in South Kalimantan and South Sumatra . [85] Indonesia is also the world's largest producer of nickel , [86] and the second-largest producer of cobalt in 2022. [87] Two US firms operate three copper/gold mines in Indonesia, with a Canadian and British firm holding significant other investments in nickel and gold, respectively. India's fortune groups like Vedanta Resources and Tata Group also have substantial mining operations in Indonesia. In 1998, the value of Indonesian gold and copper production was $1 billion and $843 million respectively. Receipts from gold, copper, and coal accounted for 84% of the $3 billion earned in 1998 by the mineral mining sector. With the addition of Alumina project that produces 5% of the world's alumina production, Indonesia would be the world's second-largest Alumina producer. The project will not make the ores to become aluminum, as there are 100 types of Alumina derivatives that can be developed further by other companies in Indonesia. [88] Joko Widodo 's administration continued the resource nationalism policy of SBY, nationalizing some assets controlled by multinational companies such as Freeport McMoRan , TotalEnergies and Chevron . In 2018, in a move aimed to cut imports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude oil to state-owned Pertamina . [89]",

Put into perspective, Indonesia's manufacturing sector is now larger than the manufacturing sectors of the United Kingdom , Russia and Mexico . Industry sector (including manufacturing) which accounts for 21% of local workers (having become more prominent in recent years). Indonesia's labour pool is estimated at 120 million people, and is growing annually by approximately 2.4 million. As the economy has progressed beyond its predominantly agricultural base to a mixed composition, more workers – particularly women – are now employed in manufacturing and service-related professional industries. [91] With its rapidly growing middle class and competitive workforce, more foreign investors than ever before are taking advantage of Indonesia's strong manufacturing sector. However, the sector has significant challenges, including intense international competition, particularly from China , increasing labour costs, high transportation and logistics costs, difficulties getting credit, and varying levels of transparency and clarity in regulations.",

        "text": "Since the late 1980s, Indonesia has made significant changes to its regulatory framework to encourage economic growth. This growth was financed mostly from private investment, both foreign and domestic. US investors dominated the oil and gas sector and undertook some of Indonesia's largest mining projects. In addition, the presence of US banks, manufacturers, and service providers expanded, especially after the industrial and financial sector reforms of the 1980s. Other major foreign investors included India, Japan, the UK, Singapore, the Netherlands, Qatar, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. The 1997 crisis made continued private financing imperative but problematic. New foreign investment approvals fell by almost two-thirds between 1997 and 1999. The crisis further highlighted areas where additional reform was needed. Frequently cited areas for improving the investment climate were the establishment of a functioning legal and judicial system, adherence to competitive processes, and adoption of internationally acceptable accounting and disclosure standards. Despite improvements of laws in recent years, Indonesia's intellectual property rights regime remains weak, and lack of effective enforcement is a significant concern. Under Suharto, Indonesia had moved towards the private provision of public infrastructure, including electric power, toll roads, and telecommunications. The 1997 crisis brought to light a severe weakness in the process of dispute resolution, however, particularly in the area of private infrastructure projects. Although Indonesia continued to have the advantages of a large labour force, abundant natural resources and modern infrastructure, private investment in new projects largely ceased during the crisis. As of 28 June 2010, the Indonesia Stock Exchange had 341 listed companies with a combined market capitalization of $269.9 billion. [144] As of November 2010, two-thirds of the market capitalization was in the form of foreign funds, and only around 1% of the population have stock investments. [145] Efforts are further being made to improve the business and investment environment. Within the World Bank 's Doing Business Survey, [146] Indonesia rose to 122 out of 178 countries in 2010, from 129 in the previous year. Despite these efforts, the rank is still below regional peers, and an unfavorable investment climate persists. For example, potential foreign investors and their executive staff cannot maintain their own bank accounts in Indonesia, unless they are tax-paying local residents (paying tax in Indonesia for their worldwide income). [ citation needed ] From 1990 to 2010, Indonesian companies have been involved in 3,757 mergers and acquisitions as either acquirer or target with a total known value of $137 billion. [147] In 2010, 609 transactions were announced, which is a new record. Numbers had increased by 19% compared to 2009. The value of deals in 2010 was US$17 billion, which is the second-highest number ever. In 2012, Indonesia realized total investments of $32.5 billion, surpassing its annual target $25 billion, as reported by Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) on 22 January. The primary investments were in the mining, transport and chemicals sectors. [148] In 2011, the Indonesian government announced a new Masterplan (known as the MP3EI , or Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia , the Masterplan to Accelerate and Expand Economic Development in Indonesia ).  The aim was to encourage increased investment, particularly in infrastructure projects across Indonesia . [149] Indonesia regained its investment grade rating from Fitch Rating in late 2011, and from Moody's Rating in early 2012, after losing it in the 1997 crisis, during which Indonesia spent more than Rp. 450 trillion ($50 billion) to bail out lenders from banks. [ citation needed ] Fitch raised Indonesia's long-term and local currency debt rating to BBB− from BB+ with both ratings is stable. Fitch also predicted that the economy would grow at least 6% on average per year through 2013, despite a less conducive global economic climate. Moody's raised Indonesia's foreign and local currency bond ratings to Baa3 from Ba1 with a stable outlook. [150] In May 2017, S&P Global raised Indonesia's investment grade from BB+ to BBB− with a stable outlook, due to the economy experiencing a rebound in exports and strong consumer spending during early 2017.

Two particularly important components of Morocco's industrial makeup are processing raw materials for export and manufacturing consumer goods for the domestic market. Many operations date to the colonial period . Until the early 1980s, government involvement was dominant and the major focus was on import substitution. Since then the emphasis has shifted to privatizing state operations and attracting new private investment , including foreign sources. Processing phosphate ore into fertilizers and phosphoric acid for export is a major economic activity. Food processing for export (canning fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit) as well as for domestic needs (flour milling and sugar refining) is also important, and the manufacture of textiles and clothes using domestically produced cotton and wool is a major source of foreign exchange. Morocco's iron and steel manufacturing industry is small but provides a significant share of the country's domestic needs. The manufacturing sector produces light consumer goods, especially foodstuffs, beverages, textiles, matches, and metal and leather products. Heavy industry is largely limited to petroleum refining , chemical fertilizers, automobile and tractor assembly, foundry work, asphalt, and cement. Many of the processed agricultural products and consumer goods are primarily for local consumption, but Morocco exports canned fish and fruit, wine, leather goods, and textiles, as well as such traditional Moroccan handicrafts as carpets and brass, copper, silver, and wood implements. Ownership in the manufacturing sector is largely private. The government owns the phosphate-chemical fertilizer industry and much of the sugar-milling capacity, through either partnership or joint financing. It is also a major participant in the car and truck assembly industry and in tire manufacturing.",

Morocco has developed an ambitious strategy, dubbed \"Vision 2010\", aimed at attracting 10 million tourists by 2010. This strategy provides for creating 160,000 beds, thus bringing the national capacity to 230,000 beds. It also aims to create some 600,000 new jobs. Marrakech continues to be the market leader, but the case of Fez , showing a 20% increase of visitors in 2004, gives hope that better organisation can bring results in diversifying the sector as a whole. Like other regions, Fez has its Centre Regional du Tourisme (CRT), a local tourism body which coordinates the local industry and the authorities. Fez's plan involves a substantial restructuring of the old city and an upgrading of hotel capacity. Improved transport has brought the city into more direct contact with potential visitors. There are now direct flights from France , where previously it was necessary to change plane in Casablanca .

Total assets of the banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion ($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of 18.1%. The structure of the domestic sector has remained steady in the past two years, with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state has started to remove itself from the domestic sector by surrendering part of its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile, foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing companies. The financial system, though robust, has to take on excessive quantities of low risk-low return government debt at the expense of riskier, but more productive private sector lending. This crowding–out of private sector investment reduces the profitability and growth incentives of the financial sector. Fitch Ratings affirmed Morocco's long-term local and foreign issuer default ratings of \"BBB−\" and \"BBB\", respectively, with a stable outlook.

Noting however that human resources remain the major concern for companies seeking to gain a foothold in Morocco. In this regard, it has been deemed an important decision of the Moroccan government to accelerate training in the required disciplines. In a bid to promote foreign investments, Morocco in 2007 adopted a series of measures and legal provisions to simplify procedures and secure appropriate conditions for projects launching and completing. Foreign trade minister, Abdellatif Maazouz cited that these measures include financial incentives and tax exemptions provided for in the investment code and the regional investment centres established to accompany projects. [77] These measures combined with actions carried out by the Hassan II Fund for Development increased foreign investments in Morocco by $544.7 million in 2007. 20% of these investments came from Islamic countries. Moroccan officials have heralded a significant increase in the amount of money Moroccan expatriates are sending home. Government efforts are underway to encourage Moroccans living abroad to increase their investments at home, and to allay concerns about bureaucracy and corruption. With money sent home by Moroccan migrants reaching $5.7 billion in 2007, Morocco came in second, behind Egypt , on the recent World Bank list of the top 10 MENA remittance recipient countries. Neighbouring Algeria ($2.9 billion) came in at number five. According to the World Bank, remittances constituted 6.4% of GDP in Morocco in 2020 and amounted to more than $7.4 billion.

It is the first phase of what is planned to eventually be a 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) high-speed rail network in Morocco. an extension of the line to Marrakesh is already being planned. Morocco also has the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean called Tanger-Med , which is ranked the 18th in the world with a handling capacity of over 9 million containers. It is situated in the Tangiers free economic zone and serves as a logistics hub for Africa and the world. [88]",

[98] [99] Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. [100] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 km 2 (14 million acres) cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. [98] There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors. [101] Rice accounts for almost all of Japan's cereal production. [102] Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. [102] Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%. [99] [103] Although Japan is usually self-sufficient in rice (except for its use in making rice crackers and processed foods) and wheat, the country must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops and relies on imports for half of its supply of meat. [104] [105] Japan imports large quantities of wheat and soybeans . [102] Japan is the 5th largest market for the European Union's agricultural exports. [106] [ needs update ] Over 90% of mandarin oranges in Japan are grown in Japan. [105] Apples are also grown due to restrictions on apple imports. [107]",

[109] In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. [110] In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. [111] Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period. Coastal fishing by small boats, set nets, or breeding techniques accounts for about one third of the industry's total production, while offshore fishing by medium-sized boats makes up for more than half the total production. Deep-sea fishing from larger vessels makes up the rest. Among the many species of seafood caught are sardines, skipjack tuna , crab, shrimp, salmon, pollock , squid, clams, mackerel , sea bream , sauries , tuna and Japanese amberjack . Freshwater fishing, including salmon, trout and eel hatcheries and fish farms, [112] takes up about 30% of Japan's fishing industry. Among the nearly 300 fish species in the rivers of Japan are native varieties of catfish, chub, herring and goby, as well as such freshwater crustaceans as crabs and crayfish. [113] Marine and freshwater aquaculture is conducted in all 47 prefectures in Japan. [110] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, [114] prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna . [115] Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling . [116]",

[153] In 2005, one half of Japan's energy was produced from petroleum, a fifth from coal, and 14% from natural gas. [154] Nuclear power in Japan made a quarter of electricity production but due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster there has been a large desire to end Japan's nuclear power program. [155] [156] In September 2013, Japan closed its last 50 nuclear power plants nationwide, causing the nation to be nuclear free. [157] The country has since then opted to restart a few of its nuclear reactors. [158] Japan's spendings on roads has been considered large. [159] The 1.2 million kilometers of paved road are one of the major means of transportation. [160] Japan has left-hand traffic . [161] A single network of speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises . [162] New and used cars are inexpensive, and the Japanese government has encouraged people to buy hybrid vehicles . [163] Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy-efficiency. [163] Rail transport is a major means of transport in Japan. Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; for instance, 6 passenger JR enterprises, Kintetsu Railway , Seibu Railway , and Keio Corporation . [164] Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations , and many major stations have major department stores near them. [165] The Japanese cities of Fukuoka , Kobe , Kyoto , Nagoya , Osaka , Sapporo , Sendai , Tokyo and Yokohama all have subway systems. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. [166] All trains are known for punctuality, and a delay of 90 seconds can be considered late for some train services. [167] There are 98 passenger and 175 total airports in Japan , and flying is a popular way to travel. [168] [169] The largest domestic airport, Tokyo International Airport , is Asia's second busiest airport . [170] The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). [171] The largest ports in Japan include Nagoya Port , the Port of Yokohama , the Port of Tokyo and the Port of Kobe . [172] About 84% of Japan's energy is imported from other countries. [173] [174] Japan is the world's largest liquefied natural gas importer, second largest coal importer, and third largest net oil importer. [175] Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources. [176] Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from 77.4% in 1973 to about 43.7% in 2010 and increased dependence on natural gas and nuclear power. [177] In September 2019, Japan will invest 10 billion on liquefied natural gas projects worldwide, in a strategy to boost the global LNG market and reinforce the security of energy supply. [178] Other important energy source includes coal, and hydroelectricity is Japan's biggest renewable energy source. [179] [180] Japan's solar market is also currently booming. [181] Kerosene is also used extensively for home heating in portable heaters, especially farther north. [182] Many taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied natural gas. [183] A recent success towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass-produced hybrid vehicles . [163] Prime Minister Shinzō Abe , who was working on Japan's economic revival, signed a treaty with Saudi Arabia and UAE about the rising prices of oil, ensuring Japan's stable deliveries from that region.

[197] One major long-term concern for the Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. [198] In 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population had already started. [199] While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would be to increase immigration , Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants despite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled workers) compared to other developed countries. [200] This is also apparent when looking at Japan's work visa programme for \"specified skilled worker\", which had less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000 overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting migrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration policies. [201] A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to Japan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country's low migrant inflow. [202] [203] In 1989, the predominantly public sector union confederation, SOHYO (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), merged with RENGO (Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation . Labor union membership is about 12 million. As of 2019 Japan's unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7. [204] Its employment rate for the working-age population (15–64) was the highest in the G7.

Filipinos who go abroad to work–-known as Overseas Filipino Workers or OFWs—are a significant contributor to the economy but are not reflected in the below sectoral discussion of the domestic economy. OFW remittances is also credited for the Philippines' recent economic growth resulting in investment status upgrades from credit ratings agencies such as the Fitch Group and Standard & Poor's .

[ citation needed ] Philippine mineral exports amounted to US$4.22 billion in 2020. [81] Low metal prices, high production costs, lack of investment in infrastructure, and a challenge to the new mining law have contributed to the mining industry's overall decline.

[91] The majority of the top ten BPO firms of the United States operate in the Philippines. [92] Call centers began in the Philippines as plain providers of email response and managing services and is a major source of employment. Call center services include customer relations, ranging from travel services, technical support, education, customer care, financial services, online business to customer support, and online business-to-business support. The Philippines is considered as a location of choice due to its many outsourcing benefits such as less expensive operational and labor costs, the high proficiency in spoken English of a significant number of its people, and a highly educated labor pool. [93] [94] The growth in the BPO industry is promoted by the Philippine government. The industry is highlighted by the Philippines Development Plan as among the 10 high potential and priority development areas. The government provides incentive programs such as tax holidays, tax exemptions, and simplified export and import procedures. Additionally, training is also available for BPO applicants. [95]",
