        "text": "Zinc makes up about 75 ppm (0.0075%) of Earth's crust , making it the 24th most abundant element. [29] It also makes up 312 ppm of the solar system, where it is the 22nd most abundant element. [30] Typical background concentrations of zinc do not exceed 1 μg/m 3 in the atmosphere; 300 mg/kg in soil; 100 mg/kg in vegetation; 20 μg/L in freshwater and 5 μg/L in seawater. [31] The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores . [32] Zinc is a chalcophile , meaning the element is more likely to be found in minerals together with sulfur and other heavy chalcogens , rather than with the light chalcogen oxygen or with non-chalcogen electronegative elements such as the halogens . Sulfides formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. [33] Sphalerite , which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. [32] Other source minerals for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate ), hemimorphite (zinc silicate ), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate ). [34] With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides. [33] Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes . [35] [36] Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, with the largest reserves in Iran . [33] [37] [38] The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. [39] Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) at the time of determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use. [40] [41] [42]",

The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions. [48] The other chalcogenides ( ZnS , ZnSe , and ZnTe ) have varied applications in electronics and optics. [60] Pnictogenides ( Zn 3 N 2 , Zn 3 P 2 , Zn 3 As 2 and Zn 3 Sb 2 ), [61] [62] the peroxide ( ZnO 2 ), the hydride ( ZnH 2 ), and the carbide ( ZnC 2 ) are also known. [63] Of the four halides , ZnF 2 has the most ionic character, while the others ( ZnCl 2 , ZnBr 2 , and ZnI 2 ) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character. [64] In weak basic solutions containing Zn 2+ ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH) 2 forms as a white precipitate . In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates ( [Zn(OH) 4 ] 2− ). [48] The nitrate Zn(NO 3 ) 2 , chlorate Zn(ClO 3 ) 2 , sulfate ZnSO 4 , phosphate Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 , molybdate ZnMoO 4 , cyanide Zn(CN) 2 , arsenite Zn(AsO 2 ) 2 , arsenate Zn(AsO 4 ) 2 ·8H 2 O and the chromate ZnCrO 4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. [65] [66] Organozinc compounds are those that contain zinc– carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc ( (C 2 H 5 ) 2 Zn ) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide , and was the first compound known to contain a metal–carbon sigma bond . [67]",

[35] The world's largest zinc producer is Nyrstar , a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore . [104] About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc. [105] Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated SHG , and is 99.995% pure. [106] Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. [107] : 6 Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014. [35] Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . [108] : 7 The ore is finely ground, then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gangue (on the property of hydrophobicity ), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate [108] : 16 consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% SiO 2 . [108] : 16 Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide: [107] The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate , zinc silicate , or zinc-spinel (like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia ) are used for zinc production, the roasting can be omitted. [109] For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning . Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 °C (1,740 °F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those temperatures. [110] The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. [107] The equations below describe this process: [107] In electrowinning , zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid and impurities are precipitated: [111] Finally, the zinc is reduced by electrolysis . [107] The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step. When galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace , the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominantly the Waelz process (90% as of 2014). [112]",

About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. [113] The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. [113] About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Man-made and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1. [10] Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm. [114] Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine , for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb. [114] Concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood. [115] Soils contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples. [114]",

        "text": "Zinc is most commonly used as an anti- corrosion agent, [119] and galvanization (coating of iron or steel ) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893,000 tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization. [118] Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. [120] A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3 ) 2 ) forms as the zinc corrodes. [121] This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. [121] The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies. [122] The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. [121] Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. [121] [d] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. [123] A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. [120] Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection. With a standard electrode potential (SEP) of −0.76 volts , zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of zinc–carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc. [124] [125] Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc–air battery /fuel cell. [126] [127] [128] The zinc-cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell. [129]",

        "text": "A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. [121] Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance . [121] These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. [121] Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver , typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . [23] Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. [130] Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc has been the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982. [131] The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States. [132] Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. [23] These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . [133] An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. [23] [134] Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. [23] [135] This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement. [23] Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. [136] For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing , roll forming , or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. [137] Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes. [137] As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns , zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing [138] to tire balances and flywheels. [139] Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. [140] These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. [140] When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays. [140]",

Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disperse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). [122] The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. [141] The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production . [142] Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant [143] and sometimes as a wood preservative . [144] It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. [143] Zinc methyl ( Zn(CH 3 ) 2 ) is used in a number of organic syntheses . [145] Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints . [146] Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid- infrared part of the spectrum. [147] Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. [143] Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints. [148] Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets . [149] When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. [149] This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light. [149] Zinc sheet metal is used as a durable covering for roofs, walls, and countertops, the last often seen in bistros and oyster bars , and is known for the rustic look imparted by its surface oxidation in use to a blue-gray patina and susceptibility to scratching. [150] [151] [152] [153] 64 Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65 Zn , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64 Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another, better-known salting material). [154] A jacket of isotopically enriched 64 Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65 Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout . [154] Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used. [154] 65 Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms. [155] Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides ; these include Zineb , Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. [156] Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. [157] Zinc in the form of ZDDP , is used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil. [158]",

[160] [161] [162] [163] Among important applications are: Zinc has found many uses in catalysis in organic synthesis including enantioselective synthesis , being a cheap and readily available alternative to precious metal complexes. Quantitative results (yield and enantiomeric excess ) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts can be comparable to those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others. [166]",

[201] The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry , which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. [202] Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase , which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively. [203] In vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO 2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO 2 for exhalation through the lungs. [204] Without this enzyme, this conversion would occur about one million times slower [205] at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more. [206] The non-related β-carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole acetic acid (auxin) and alcoholic fermentation . [207] Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested. [203]",

With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds, including sesame , poppy , alfalfa , celery , and mustard . [223] Zinc is also found in beans , nuts , almonds , whole grains , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , and blackcurrant . [224] Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. [225] This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. [225] For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. [226] A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.

[69] [71] A 2018 meta-analysis found no evidence that intake of vitamin D or calcium for community-dwelling elderly people reduced bone fractures. [72] Europe has regulations that define limits of vitamin (and mineral) dosages for their safe use as dietary supplements. Most vitamins that are sold as dietary supplements are not supposed to exceed a maximum daily dosage referred to as the tolerable upper intake level (UL or Upper Limit). Vitamin products above these regulatory limits are not considered supplements and should be registered as prescription or non-prescription ( over-the-counter drugs ) due to their potential side effects. The European Union, United States and Japan establish ULs. [11] [59] [60] Dietary supplements often contain vitamins, but may also include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. [73] In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. [73] They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.",

If soaked for 12–24 hours before use, cooking time can be shortened by around 30 minutes. Chickpeas can also be pressure cooked or sous vide cooked at 90 °C (194 °F). Mature chickpeas can be cooked and eaten cold in salads , cooked in stews , ground into flour, ground and shaped in balls and fried as falafel , made into a batter and baked to make farinata or socca , or fried to make panelle . Chickpea flour is known as gram flour or besan in South Asia and is used frequently in South Asian cuisine . In Portugal , chickpeas are one of the main ingredients in rancho , eaten with pasta, meat, or rice. They are used in other hot dishes with bacalhau and in soups, meat stews, salads mixed with tuna and vegetables, olive oil, vinegar, hot pepper and salt. In Spain, they are used cold in tapas and salads, as well as in cocido madrileño . Hummus is the Arabic word for chickpeas, which are often cooked and ground into a paste and mixed with tahini (sesame seed paste) to make ḥummuṣ bi ṭaḥīna , usually called simply hummus in English. By the end of the 20th century, hummus had become common in American cuisine: [23] by 2010, 5% of Americans consumed it regularly, [23] and it was present at some point in 17% of American households. [24] In the Middle East, chickpeas are also roasted, spiced, and eaten as a snack, such as leblebi . Chickpeas and Bengal grams are used to make curries. [25] They are one of the most popular vegetarian foods in the Indian subcontinent [26] and in diaspora communities of many other countries, served with a variety of bread or steamed rice. Popular dishes in Indian cuisine are made with chickpea flour, such as mirchi bajji and mirapakaya bajji. [27] In India, as well as in the Levant , unripe chickpeas are often picked out of the pod and eaten as a raw snack, and the leaves are eaten as a leaf vegetable in salads. In India, desserts such as besan halwa [28] and sweets such as mysore pak , and laddu are made. Chickpea flour is used to make \" Burmese tofu \", which was first known among the Shan people of Burma . In South Asian cuisine, chickpea flour ( besan ) is used as a batter to coat vegetables before deep frying to make pakoras . The flour is also used as a batter to coat vegetables and meats before frying or fried alone, such as panelle (little bread), a chickpea fritter from Sicily . Chickpea flour is used to make the Mediterranean flatbread socca and is called panisse in Provence, southern France. It is made of cooked chickpea flour, poured into saucers, allowed to set, cut into strips, and fried in olive oil, often eaten during Lent. In Tuscany, chickpea flour (farina di ceci) is used to make an oven-baked pancake: the flour is mixed with water, oil and salt. Chickpea flour, known as kadlehittu in Kannada , is used for making sweet dish Mysore pak . In the Philippines , chickpeas preserved in syrup are eaten as sweets and in desserts such as halo-halo . Ashkenazi Jews traditionally serve whole chickpeas, referred to as arbes (אַרבעס) in Yiddish, at the Shalom Zachar celebration for baby boys. The chickpeas are boiled until soft and served hot with salt and lots of ground black pepper. [29] Guasanas or garbanza is a Mexican chickpea street snack. The beans, while still green, are cooked in water and salt, kept in a steamer to maintain their humidity, and served in a plastic bag. A chickpea-derived liquid ( aquafaba ) can be used as an egg white replacement to make meringue [30] or ice cream, with the residual pomace used as flour. [31]",
