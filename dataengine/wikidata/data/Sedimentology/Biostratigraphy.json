        "text": "Index fossils (also known as guide fossils , indicator fossils , or dating fossils ) are the fossilized remains or traces of particular plants or animals that are characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment, and can be used to identify and date the containing rocks. To be practical, index fossils must have a limited vertical time range, wide geographic distribution, and rapid evolutionary trends. Rock formations separated by great distances but containing the same index fossil species are thereby known to have both formed during the limited time that the species lived. Index fossils were originally used to define and identify geologic units, then became a basis for defining geologic periods , and then for faunal stages and zones. Ammonites , graptolites , archeocyathids , inoceramids , and trilobites are groups of animals from which many species have been identified as index fossils that are widely used in biostratigraphy. Species of microfossils such as acritarchs , chitinozoans , conodonts , dinoflagellate cysts, ostracods , pollen , spores and foraminiferans are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of Cambrian age. A long series of ammonite and inoceramid species are particularly useful for correlating environmental events around the world during the super-greenhouse of the Late Cretaceous . [7] [8] To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can be found in many different places. They must also be short-lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favored over forms that evolve much more slowly, like nautiloids . Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a faunal assemblage , rather than an individual species — this allows greater precision as the time span in which all of the species in the assemblage existed together is narrower than the time spans of any of the members. Furthermore, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean either that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; or (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range. For instance, the presence of the trace fossil Treptichnus pedum was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata. [9] If the fossil is easy to preserve and easy to identify, more precise time estimating of the stratigraphic layers is possible.",

When William was studying rock strata he began to recognize that rock outcrops contained a unique collection of fossils. [10] The idea that these distant rock outcrops contained similar fossils allowed for Smith to order rock formations throughout England. With Smith's work on these rock outcrops and mapping around England, he began to notice some beds of rock may contain mostly similar species, however there were also subtle differences within or between these fossil groups. This difference in assemblages that appeared identical at first, lead to the principle of faunal succession, where fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order, and therefore any time period can be categorized by its fossil extent.

Graptolites and ammonites are some of the most useful as zone fossils, as they preserve well and often have relatively short biozones. [4] Microfossils , such as dinoflagellates , foraminiferans , or plant pollen are also good candidates because they tend to be present even in very small samples and evolve relatively rapidly. [4] [7] Fossils of pigs [8] and cannabis [9] can be used for biozonation of Quaternary rocks as they were used by hominids . [4] As only a small portion of fossils are preserved, a biozone does not represent the true range of that species in time. Moreover, ranges can be influenced by the Signor-Lipps effect , meaning that the last \"disappearance\" of a species tends to be observed further back in time than was actually the case. [10]",

        "section": "Comparison with biostratigraphy",
        "text": "In sedimentary rocks , fossils are the only widely applicable tool for time correlation. [1] : 229 Evolution leaves a record of progressive change, sequential and nonrepeating. [1] : 230 A rock unit has a characteristic assemblage of fossils , independent of its lithology . [1] : 229 Thus, the fossils can be used to compare the ages of different rock units. The basic unit of biochronology is the biostratigraphic zone, or biozone , a collection of fossils found together in a rock unit. This is used as the basis of a biochron , \"a unit of time in which an association of taxa is interpreted to have lived.\" [1] : 229 However, a biozone may vary in age from one location or another. For example, a given taxon may migrate, so its first appearance varies from place to place. In particular, facies-controlled organisms (organisms that lived in a particular sedimentary environment ) are not well suited for biochronology because they move with their environment and may change little over long periods of time. [1] : 230–231 Thus, biostratigraphers search for species that are particularly widespread, abundant, and not tied to particular sedimentary environments. This is particularly true of free-swimming animals such as benthic foraminifera , which readily spread throughout the world's oceans. [1] : 230 Another challenge for stratigraphy is that there are often large gaps in the fossil record at a given location. To counter this, biostratigraphers search for a particularly well-preserved section that can be used as the type section for a particular biostratographic unit. As an example, the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian periods is marked by the first appearance of the graptolite Mongraptus uniformus uniformus in a section in Klonk , Czech Republic . [1] : 237 In terrestrial deposits, fossils of land mammals and other vertebrates are used as stratigraphic tools, but they have some disadvantages relative to marine fossils. They are seldom evenly distributed through a section, and they tend to occur in isolated pockets with few overlaps between biozones. Thus, correlations between biozones is often indirect, inferred using a knowledge of their sequence of evolution. [1] : 240 This practice was first proposed by H. S. Williams in 1941. In the United States, biochronology is widely used as a synonym for biostratigraphy , but in Canada and Europe the term is reserved for biochronology that is not tied to a particular stratigraphic section. [2] This form of biochronology is not recognized by the International Stratigraphic Guide, but it is \"really what a great many paleontologists and stratigraphers are after ... an optimum network of fossil correlations, thought to embody a reliable and high-resolution isochronous time (lines) framework.\" [3]",

        "text": "Jean Léopold Nicolas Frédéric Cuvier was born in Montbéliard , where his Protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the Reformation. [10] His mother was Anne Clémence Chatel; his father, Jean George Cuvier, was a lieutenant in the Swiss Guards and a bourgeois of the town of Montbéliard. [11] At the time, the town, which would be annexed to France on 10 October 1793, belonged to the Duchy of Württemberg . His mother, who was much younger than his father, tutored him diligently throughout his early years, so he easily surpassed the other children at school. [10] During his gymnasium years, he had little trouble acquiring Latin and Greek, and was always at the head of his class in mathematics, history, and geography. [12] According to Lee, [12] \"The history of mankind was, from the earliest period of his life, a subject of the most indefatigable application; and long lists of sovereigns, princes, and the driest chronological facts, once arranged in his memory, were never forgotten.\" At the age of 10, soon after entering the gymnasium , he encountered a copy of Conrad Gessner 's Historiae Animalium , the work that first sparked his interest in natural history . He then began frequent visits to the home of a relative, where he could borrow volumes of the Comte de Buffon 's massive Histoire Naturelle . All of these he read and reread, retaining so much of the information, that by the age of 12, \"he was as familiar with quadrupeds and birds as a first-rate naturalist.\" [12] He remained at the gymnasium for four years. Cuvier spent an additional four years at the Caroline Academy in Stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework. Although he knew no German on his arrival, after only nine months of study, he managed to win the school prize for that language. Cuvier's German education exposed him to the work of the geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner (1750–1817), whose Neptunism and emphasis on the importance of rigorous, direct observation of three-dimensional, structural relationships of rock formations to geological understanding provided models for Cuvier's scientific theories and methods. [14] Upon graduation, he had no money on which to live as he awaited an appointment to an academic office. So in July 1788, he took a job at Fiquainville chateau in Normandy as tutor to the only son of the Comte d'Héricy , a Protestant noble. There, during the early 1790s, he began his comparisons of fossils with extant forms. Cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of Valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics. There, he became acquainted with Henri Alexandre Tessier (1741–1837), who had assumed a false identity. Previously, he had been a physician and well-known agronomist, who had fled the Terror in Paris. After hearing Tessier speak on agricultural matters, Cuvier recognized him as the author of certain articles on agriculture in the Encyclopédie Méthodique and addressed him as M. Tessier. Tessier replied in dismay, \"I am known, then, and consequently lost.\"—\"Lost!\" replied M. Cuvier, \"no; you are henceforth the object of our most anxious care.\" [15] They soon became intimate and Tessier introduced Cuvier to his colleagues in Paris\"I have just found a pearl in the dunghill of Normandy\", he wrote his friend Antoine-Augustin Parmentier . [16] As a result, Cuvier entered into correspondence with several leading naturalists of the day and was invited to Paris. Arriving in the spring of 1795, at the age of 26, he soon became the assistant of Jean-Claude Mertrud (1728–1802), who had been appointed to the chair of Animal Anatomy at the Jardin des Plantes . When Mertrud died in 1802, Cuvier replaced him in office and the Chair changed its name to Chair of Comparative Anatomy . [17] The Institut de France was founded in the same year, and he was elected a member of its Academy of Sciences . On 4 April 1796 he began to lecture at the École Centrale du Pantheon and, at the opening of the National Institute in April, he read his first paleontological paper, which subsequently was published in 1800 under the title Mémoires sur les espèces d'éléphants vivants et fossiles . [18] In this paper, he analyzed skeletal remains of Indian and African elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the \"Ohio animal\". In his second paper in 1796, he described and analyzed a large skeleton found in Paraguay , which he would name Megatherium . [5] He concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and, by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths, that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth . Together, these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event, becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well. They also greatly enhanced Cuvier's personal reputation and they essentially ended what had been a long-running debate about the reality of extinction . In 1799, he succeeded Daubenton as professor of natural history in the Collège de France . In 1802, he became titular professor at the Jardin des Plantes ; and in the same year, he was appointed commissary of the institute to accompany the inspectors general of public instruction. In this latter capacity, he visited the south of France, but in the early part of 1803, he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the Academy, and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to Paris. [18] In 1806, he became a foreign member of the Royal Society , and in 1812, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . In 1812, he became a correspondent for the Royal Institute of the Netherlands , and became a member in 1827. [19] Cuvier was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822. [20] Cuvier then devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry: (i) the structure and classification of the Mollusca ; (ii) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes; (iii) fossil mammals and reptiles and, secondarily, the osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups. [18] In 1812, Cuvier made what the cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans called his \"Rash dictum\": he remarked that it was unlikely that any large animal remained undiscovered. Ten years after his death, the word \"dinosaur\" would be coined by Richard Owen in 1842. During his lifetime, Cuvier served as an imperial councillor under Napoleon , president of the Council of Public Instruction and chancellor of the university under the restored Bourbons , Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, a Peer of France, Minister of the Interior, and president of the Council of State under Louis Philippe . He was eminent in all these capacities, and yet the dignity given by such high administrative positions was as nothing compared to his leadership in natural science. [21] Cuvier was by birth, education, and conviction a devout Lutheran , [22] and remained Protestant throughout his life while regularly attending church services . Despite this, he regarded his personal faith as a private matter; he evidently identified himself with his confessional minority group when he supervised governmental educational programs for Protestants . He also was very active in founding the Parisian Biblical Society in 1818, where he later served as a vice president. [23] From 1822 until his death in 1832, Cuvier was Grand Master of the Protestant Faculties of Theology of the French University. [24]",

        "section": "Opposition to evolution",
        "text": "Cuvier was critical of theories of evolution, in particular those proposed by his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another. He repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated one fossil form does not, as a rule, gradually change into a succeeding, distinct fossil form. A deep-rooted source of his opposition to the gradual transformation of species was his goal of creating an accurate taxonomy based on principles of comparative anatomy. [25] Such a project would become impossible if species were mutable, with no clear boundaries between them. According to the University of California Museum of Paleontology, \"Cuvier did not believe in organic evolution, for any change in an organism's anatomy would have rendered it unable to survive. He studied the mummified cats and ibises that Geoffroy had brought back from Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, and showed they were no different from their living counterparts; Cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time.\" [26] [27] He also observed that Napoleon's expedition to Egypt had retrieved animals mummified thousands of years previously that seemed no different from their modern counterparts. [28] \"Certainly\", Cuvier wrote, \"one cannot detect any greater difference between these creatures and those we see, than between the human mummies and the skeletons of present-day men.\" [29] Lamarck dismissed this conclusion, arguing that evolution happened much too slowly to be observed over just a few thousand years. Cuvier, however, in turn criticized how Lamarck and other naturalists conveniently introduced hundreds of thousands of years \"with a stroke of a pen\" to uphold their theory. Instead, he argued that one may judge what a long time would produce only by multiplying what a lesser time produces. Since a lesser time produced no organic changes, neither, he argued, would a much longer time. [30] Moreover, his commitment to the principle of the correlation of parts caused him to doubt that any mechanism could ever gradually modify any part of an animal in isolation from all the other parts (in the way Lamarck proposed), without rendering the animal unable to survive. [31] In his Éloge de M. de Lamarck ( Praise for M. de Lamarck ), [32] [33] Cuvier wrote that Lamarck's theory of evolution Instead, he said, the typical form makes an abrupt appearance in the fossil record, and persists unchanged to the time of its extinction. Cuvier attempted to explain this paleontological phenomenon he envisioned (which would be readdressed more than a century later by \" punctuated equilibrium \") and to harmonize it with the Bible . He attributed the different time periods he was aware of as intervals between major catastrophes, the last of which is found in Genesis . [34] [35] Cuvier's claim that new fossil forms appear abruptly in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata was used by later critics of evolution to support creationism, [36] to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation (although Cuvier's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not). The lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of \"species\", but, again, the idea of extinction, of which Cuvier was the great proponent, obviously was not. Many writers have unjustly accused Cuvier of obstinately maintaining that fossil human beings could never be found. In his Essay on the Theory of the Earth , he did say, \"no human bones have yet been found among fossil remains\", but he made it clear exactly what he meant: \"When I assert that human bones have not been hitherto found among extraneous fossils, I must be understood to speak of fossils, or petrifactions, properly so called\". [37] Petrified bones, which have had time to mineralize and turn to stone, are typically far older than bones found to that date. Cuvier's point was that all human bones found that he knew of, were of relatively recent age because they had not been petrified and had been found only in superficial strata. [38] He was not dogmatic in this claim, however; when new evidence came to light, he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an \"instance of a fossil human petrifaction\". [39] The harshness of his criticism and the strength of his reputation, however, continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species, until Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species more than two decades after Cuvier's death.

        "section": "Extinction",
        "text": "Early in his tenure at the National Museum in Paris, Cuvier published studies of fossil bones in which he argued that they belonged to large, extinct quadrupeds. His first two such publications were those identifying mammoth and mastodon fossils as belonging to extinct species rather than modern elephants and the study in which he identified the Megatherium as a giant, extinct species of sloth. [41] His primary evidence for his identifications of mammoths and mastodons as separate, extinct species was the structure of their jaws and teeth. [42] His primary evidence that the Megatherium fossil had belonged to a massive sloth came from his comparison of its skull with those of extant sloth species. [43] Cuvier wrote of his paleontological method that \"the form of the tooth leads to the form of the condyle , that of the scapula to that of the nails, just as an equation of a curve implies all of its properties; and, just as in taking each property separately as the basis of a special equation we are able to return to the original equation and other associated properties, similarly, the nails, the scapula, the condyle, the femur, each separately reveal the tooth or each other; and by beginning from each of them the thoughtful professor of the laws of organic economy can reconstruct the entire animal.\" [44] However, Cuvier's actual method was heavily dependent on the comparison of fossil specimens with the anatomy of extant species in the necessary context of his vast knowledge of animal anatomy and access to unparalleled natural history collections in Paris. [45] This reality, however, did not prevent the rise of a popular legend that Cuvier could reconstruct the entire bodily structures of extinct animals given only a few fragments of bone. [46] At the time Cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants, it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct. Authorities such as Buffon had claimed that fossils found in Europe of animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth were remains of animals still living in the tropics (i.e. rhinoceros and elephants ), which had shifted out of Europe and Asia as the earth became cooler. Thereafter, Cuvier performed a pioneering research study on some elephant fossils excavated around Paris. The bones he studied, however, were remarkably different from the bones of elephants currently thriving in India and Africa. This discovery led Cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living. The idea that these bones belonged to elephants living – but hiding – somewhere on Earth seemed ridiculous to Cuvier, because it would be nearly impossible to miss them due to their enormous size. The Megatherium provided another compelling data point for this argument. Ultimately, his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man, combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in Paris, drove Cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the Earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct. [47] Cuvier's theory on extinction has met opposition from other notable natural scientists like Darwin and Charles Lyell . Unlike Cuvier, they didn't believe that extinction was a sudden process; they believed that like the Earth, animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species.  This differed widely from Cuvier's theory, which seemed to propose that animal extinction was catastrophic. However, Cuvier's theory of extinction is still justified in the case of mass extinctions that occurred in the last 600 million years, when approximately half of all living species went completely extinct within a short geological span of two million years, due in part by volcanic eruptions, asteroids, and rapid fluctuations in sea level. At this time, new species rose and others fell, precipitating the arrival of human beings.\nCuvier's early work demonstrated conclusively that extinction was indeed a credible natural global process. [48] Cuvier's thinking on extinctions was influenced by his extensive readings in Greek and Latin literature; he gathered every ancient report known in his day relating to discoveries of petrified bones of remarkable size in the Mediterranean region. [49] Influence on Cuvier's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the New World, many of them obtained from Native Americans. He also maintained an archive of Native American observations, legends, and interpretations of immense fossilized skeletal remains, sent to him by informants and friends in the Americas. He was impressed that most of the Native American accounts identified the enormous bones, teeth, and tusks as animals of the deep past that had been destroyed by catastrophe. [50]",

        "text": "Cuvier came to believe that most, if not all, the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct. Near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants, he said: Contrary to many natural scientists' beliefs at the time, Cuvier believed that animal extinction was not a product of anthropogenic causes. Instead, he proposed that humans were around long enough to indirectly maintain the fossilized records of ancient Earth. He also attempted to verify the water catastrophe by analyzing records of various cultural backgrounds. Though he found many accounts of the water catastrophe unclear, he did believe that such an event occurred at the brink of human history nonetheless. This led Cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals. Over the course of his career, Cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe, but several, resulting in a succession of different faunas. He wrote about these ideas many times, in particular, he discussed them in great detail in the preliminary discourse (an introduction) to a collection of his papers, Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes ( Researches on quadruped fossil bones ), on quadruped fossils published in 1812. Cuvier's own explanation for such a catastrophic event is derived from two different sources, including those from Jean-André Deluc and Déodat de Dolomieu . The former proposed that the continents existing ten millennia ago collapsed, allowing the ocean floors to rise higher than the continental plates and become the continents that now exist today. The latter proposed that a massive tsunami hit the globe, leading to mass extinction. Whatever the case was, he believed that the deluge happened quite recently in human history. In fact, he believed that Earth's existence was limited and not as extended as many natural scientists, like Lamarck , believed it to be. Much of the evidence he used to support his catastrophist theories has been taken from his fossil records. He strongly suggested that the fossils he found were evidence of the world's first reptiles, followed chronologically by mammals and humans. Cuvier didn't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on Earth. In a way, his chronological dating of Earth's history somewhat reflected Lamarck's transformationist theories. Cuvier also worked alongside Alexandre Brongniart in analyzing the Parisian rock cycle. Using stratigraphical methods, they were both able to extrapolate key information regarding Earth history from studying these rocks. These rocks contained remnants of molluscs, bones of mammals, and shells. From these findings, Cuvier and Brongniart concluded that many environmental changes occurred in quick catastrophes, though Earth itself was often placid for extended periods of time in between sudden disturbances. The 'Preliminary Discourse' became very well known and, unauthorized translations were made into English, German, and Italian (and in the case of those in English, not entirely accurately). In 1826, Cuvier published a revised version under the name, Discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe ( Discourse on the upheavals of the surface of the globe ). [51] After Cuvier's death, the catastrophic school of geological thought lost ground to uniformitarianism , as championed by Charles Lyell and others, which claimed that the geological features of the earth were best explained by currently observable forces, such as erosion and volcanism, acting gradually over an extended period of time. The increasing interest in the topic of mass extinction starting in the late twentieth century, however, has led to a resurgence of interest among historians of science and other scholars in this aspect of Cuvier's work.

In 1808 Cuvier identified a fossil found in Maastricht as a giant marine lizard, the first known mosasaur . Cuvier speculated correctly that there had been a time when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant fauna. [56] This speculation was confirmed over the two decades following his death by a series of spectacular finds, mostly by English geologists and fossil collectors such as Mary Anning , William Conybeare , William Buckland , and Gideon Mantell , who found and described the first ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs , and dinosaurs .",

        "text": "Cuvier hoped that his principles of anatomy would provide the law-based framework that would elevate natural history to the truly scientific level occupied by physics and chemistry thanks to the laws established by Isaac Newton (1643 - 1727) and Antoine Lavoisier (1743 - 1794), respectively. He expressed confidence in the introduction to Le Règne Animal that someday anatomy would be expressed as laws as simple, mathematical, and predictive as Newton's laws of physics, and he viewed his principle as an important step in that direction. [59] To him, the predictive capabilities of his principles demonstrated in his prediction of the existence of marsupial pelvic bones in the gypsum quarries of Montmartre demonstrated that these goals were not only in reach, but imminent. [60] The principle of correlation of parts was also Cuvier's way of understanding function in a non-evolutionary context, without invoking a divine creator. [61] In the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near Paris, Cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle, writing, [57] Though Cuvier believed that his principle's major contribution was that it was a rational, mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions, in reality, it was difficult for Cuvier to use his principle. The functional significance of many body parts was still unknown at the time, and so relating those body parts to other body parts using Cuvier's principle was impossible. Though Cuvier was able to make accurate predictions about fossil finds, in practice, the accuracy of his predictions came not from application of his principle, but rather from his vast knowledge of comparative anatomy. However, despite Cuvier's exaggerations of the power of his principle, the basic concept is central to comparative anatomy and paleontology. [58]",

        "section": "Comparative anatomy and classification",
        "text": "At the Paris Museum, Cuvier furthered his studies on the anatomical classification of animals.  He believed that classification should be based on how organs collectively function, a concept he called functional integration .  Cuvier reinforced the idea of subordinating less vital body parts to more critical organ systems as part of anatomical classification. He included these ideas in his 1817 book, The Animal Kingdom . In his anatomical studies, Cuvier believed function played a bigger role than form in the field of taxonomy.  His scientific beliefs rested in the idea of the principles of the correlation of parts and of the conditions of existence.  The former principle accounts for the connection between organ function and its practical use for an organism to survive.  The latter principle emphasizes the animal's physiological function in relation to its surrounding environment.  These findings were published in his scientific readings, including Leçons d'anatomie comparée ( Lessons on Comparative Anatomy ) between 1800 and 1805, [a] and The Animal Kingdom in 1817. Ultimately, Cuvier developed four embranchements, or branches, through which he classified animals based on his taxonomical and anatomical studies.  He later performed groundbreaking work in classifying animals in vertebrate and invertebrate groups by subdividing each category.  For instance, he proposed that the invertebrates could be segmented into three individual categories, including Mollusca , Radiata , and Articulata .  He also articulated that species cannot move across these categories, a theory called transmutation .  He reasoned that organisms cannot acquire or change their physical traits over time and still retain optimal survival.  As a result, he often conflicted with Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theories of transmutation. In 1798, Cuvier published his first independent work, the Tableau élémentaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux , which was an abridgement of his course of lectures at the École du Pantheon and may be regarded as the foundation and first statement of his natural classification of the animal kingdom.

[18] Among living forms he published papers relating to the osteology of the Rhinoceros indicus , the tapir , Hyrax capensis , the hippopotamus , the sloths , the manatee , etc. [18] He produced an even larger body of work on fossils, dealing with the extinct mammals of the Eocene beds of Montmartre and other localities near Paris , such as the Buttes Chaumont , [63] the fossil species of hippopotamus , Palaeotherium , Anoplotherium , a marsupial (which he called Didelphys gypsorum ), the Megalonyx , the Megatherium , the cave-hyena , the pterodactyl , the extinct species of rhinoceros , the cave bear , the mastodon , the extinct species of elephant , fossil species of manatee and seals , fossil forms of crocodilians , chelonians , fish, birds, etc. [18] If his identification of fossil animals was dependent upon comparison with the osteology of extant animals whose anatomy was poorly known, Cuvier would often publish a thorough documentation of the relevant extant species' anatomy before publishing his analyses of the fossil specimens. [64] The department of palaeontology dealing with the Mammalia may be said to have been essentially created and established by Cuvier. [18] The results of Cuvier's principal palaeontological and geological investigations ultimately were given to the world in the form of two separate works: Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupèdes (Paris, 1812; later editions in 1821 and 1825); and Discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe (Paris, 1825).

He published three separate reports on this subject. [70] In his capacity, again, of perpetual secretary of the Institute, he not only prepared a number of éloges historiques on deceased members of the Academy of Sciences, but was also the author of a number of reports on the history of the physical and natural sciences, the most important of these being the Rapport historique sur le progrès des sciences physiques depuis 1789 , published in 1810. [71] Prior to the fall of Napoleon (1814) he had been admitted to the council of state, and his position remained unaffected by the restoration of the Bourbons . He was elected chancellor of the university , in which capacity he acted as interim president of the council of public instruction, while he also, as a Lutheran , superintended the faculty of Protestant theology.
