[ citation needed ] The scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism, which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the Earth's surface today. [ citation needed ] Sedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down; the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments, from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after diagenesis are available for study. [ citation needed ] The principle of superposition is critical to the interpretation of sedimentary sequences, and in older metamorphic terrains or fold and thrust belts where sediments are often intensely folded or deformed, recognising younging indicators or graded bedding is critical to interpretation of the sedimentary section and often the deformation and metamorphic structure of the region. [ citation needed ] Folding in sediments is analysed with the principle of original horizontality , which states that sediments are deposited at their angle of repose which, for most types of sediment, is essentially horizontal. Thus, when the younging direction is known, the rocks can be \"unfolded\" and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information. The principle of lateral continuity states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions unless obstructed by a physical object or topography. The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that whatever cuts across or intrudes into the layers of strata is younger than the layers of strata.",

Two main types of carbonate platforms are distinguished on the base of their geographic setting: isolated (as Maldives atolls ) or epicontinental (as the Belize reefs or the Florida Keys ). However, the one most important factor influencing geometries is perhaps the type of carbonate factory. Depending on the dominant carbonate factory, we can distinguish three types of carbonate platforms: T-type carbonate platforms (produced by \"tropical factories\"), C-type carbonate platforms (produced by \"cool-water factories\"), M-type carbonate platforms (\"produced by mud-mound factories\").

        "text": "The depositional profile of T-type carbonate platforms can be subdivided into several sedimentary environments . [1] The carbonate hinterland is the most landward environment, composed by weathered carbonate rocks . The evaporitic tidal flat is a typical low-energy environment. The internal lagoon , as the name suggests, is the part of platform behind the reef. It is characterised by shallow and calm waters, and so it is a low-energy sedimentary environment. Sediments are composed by reef fragments, hard parts of organisms and, if the platform is epicontinental, also by a terrigenous contribution. In some lagoons (e.g., the Florida Bay ), green algae produce great volumes of carbonate mud. Rocks here are mudstones to grainstones , depending on the energy of the environment. The reef is the rigid structure of carbonate platforms and is located between the internal lagoon and the slope, in the platform margin, in which the framework produced by large-sized skeletons, as those of corals, and by encrusting organisms will resist wave action and form a rigid build up that may develop up to sea-level. Survival of the platform depends on the existence of the reef, because only this part of the platform can build a rigid, wave-resistant structure. The reef is created by essentially in-place, sessile organisms. Today's reefs are mostly built by hermatypic corals. Geologically speaking, reef rocks can be classified as massive boundstones . The slope is the outer part of the platform, connecting the reef with the basin. This depositional environment acts as sink for excess carbonate sediment: most of the sediment produced in the lagoon and reef is transported by various processes and accumulates in the slope, with an inclination depending on the grain size of sediments, and that could attain the settlement angle of gravel (30-34Â°) at most. [8] The slope contains coarser sediments than the reef and lagoon. These rocks are generally rudstones or grainstones . The periplatform basin is the outermost part of the t-type carbonate platform, and carbonate sedimentation is there dominated by density-cascating processes. [10] The presence of a rim damps the action of waves in the back reef area and a lagoon may develop in which carbonate mud is often produced. When reef accretion reaches the point that the foot of the reef is below wave base, a slope develops: the sediments of the slope derive from the erosion of the margin by waves, storms and gravitational collapses. This process accumulates coral debris in clinoforms. Clinoforms are beds that have a sigmoidal or tabular shape, but are always deposited with a primary inclination. The size of a T-type carbonate platform, from the hinterland to the foot of the slope, can be of tens of kilometers. [6]",

Scleractinia become important reef builders beginning only in the Carnian (upper Triassic ). Some of the best examples of carbonate platforms are in the Dolomites , deposited during the Triassic.

Such cycles were also observed on the Mesozoic Arabic platform, Oman and Abu Dhabi (Septfontaine & De Matos, 1998) with the same microfauna of foraminifera in an almost identical biostratigraphic succession.

This process has been observed on all rimmed carbonate platforms in the Quaternary, such as the Great Bahama Bank . Flat topped, rimmed platforms with steep slopes show more pronounced highstand shedding than platforms with gentle slopes and cool water carbonate systems. [15] Highstand shedding is pronounced on tropical carbonate platforms because of the combined effect of sediment production and diagenesis . [6] Sediment production of a platform increases with its size, and during highstand the top of the platform is flooded and the productive area is bigger compared to the lowstand conditions, when only a minimal part of the platform is available for production. [6] The effect of increased highstand production is enhanced by the rapid lithification of carbonate during lowstands, because the exposed platform top is karstified rather than eroded, and does not export sediment.

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or fossil . For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions in their search for fossil animal and plant specimens. [9] Some of the most unusual concretion nuclei are World War II military shells , bombs , and shrapnel , which are found inside siderite concretions found in an English coastal salt marsh . [10] Depending on the environmental conditions present at the time of their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth. [11] [12] In concentric growth, the concretion grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host sediments , by infilling of its pore space by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a concretion. Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.",

        "section": "Septarian concretions",
        "text": "Septarian concretions (or septarian nodules ) are carbonate -rich concretions containing angular cavities or cracks ( septaria ; sg. septarium , from the Latin septum \"partition, separating element\", referring to the cracks or cavities separating polygonal blocks of hardened material). [34] [35] Septarian nodules are characteristically found in carbonate-rich mudrock. They typically show an internal structure of polyhedral blocks (the matrix ) separated by mineral-filled radiating cracks (the septaria) which taper towards the rim of the concretion. The radiating cracks sometimes intersect a second set of concentric cracks. [36] [34] However, the cracks can be highly variable in shape and volume, as well as the degree of shrinkage they indicate. [37] The matrix is typically composed of argillaceous carbonate, such as clay ironstone, while the crack filling is usually calcite. [36] [34] The calcite often contains significant iron (ferroan calcite) and may have inclusions of pyrite and clay minerals. The brown calcite common in septaria may also be colored by organic compounds produced by bacterial decay of organic matter in the original sediments. [38] Septarian concretions are found in many kinds of mudstone, including lacustrine siltstones such as the Beaufort Group of northwest Mozambique, [39] but are most commonly found in marine shales , such as the Staffin Shale Formation of Skye , [38] the Kimmeridge Clay of England, [40] [41] or the Mancos Group of North America. [42] It is commonly thought that concretions grew incrementally from the inside outwards. Chemical and textural zoning in many concretions are consistent with this concentric model of formation. However, the evidence is ambiguous, and many or most concretions may have formed by pervasive cementation of the entire volume of the concretion at the same time. [43] [44] [38] For example, if the porosity after early cementation varies across the concretion, then later cementation filling this porosity would produce compositional zoning even with uniform pore water composition. [44] Whether the initial cementation was concentric or pervasive, there is considerable evidence that it occurred quickly and at shallow depth of burial. [45] [46] [47] [38] In many cases, there is clear evidence that the initial concretion formed around some kind of organic nucleus. [48] The origin of the carbonate-rich septaria is still debated. One possibility is that dehydration hardens the outer shell of the concretion while causing the interior matrix to shrink until it cracks. [36] [34] Shrinkage of a still-wet matrix may also take place through syneresis , in which the particles of colloidal material in the interior of the concretion become gradually more tightly bound while expelling water. [39] Another possibility is that early cementation reduces the permeability of the concretion, trapping pore fluids and creating excess pore pressure during continued burial. This could crack the interior at depths as shallow as 10 meters (33Â ft). [49] A more speculative theory is that the septaria form by brittle fracturing resulting from earthquakes . [50] Regardless of the mechanism of crack formation, the septaria, like the concretion itself, likely form at a relatively shallow depth of burial of less than 50 meters (160Â ft) [51] and possibly as little as 12 meters (39Â ft). Geologically young concretions of the Errol Beds of Scotland show texture consistent with formation from flocculated sediments containing organic matter, whose decay left tiny gas bubbles (30 to 35 microns in diameter) and a soap of calcium fatty acids salts. The conversion of these fatty acids to calcium carbonate may have promoted shrinkage and fracture of the matrix. [46] [38] One model for the formation of septarian concretions in the Staffin Shales suggests that the concretions started as semirigid masses of flocculated clay. The individual colloidal clay particles were bound by extracellular polymeric substances or EPS produced by colonizing bacteria. The decay of these substances, together with syneresis of the host mud, produced stresses that fractured the interiors of the concretions while still at shallow burial depth. This was possible only with the bacterial colonization and the right sedimentation rate. Additional fractures formed during subsequent episodes of shallow burial (during the Cretaceous) or uplift (during the Paleogene). Water derived from rain and snow (meteoric water) later infiltrated the beds and deposited ferroan calcite in the cracks. [38] Septarian concretions often record a complex history of formation that provides geologists with information on early diagenesis , the initial stages of the formation of sedimentary rock from unconsolidated sediments. Most concretions appear to have formed at depths of burial where sulfate-reducing microorganisms are active. [41] [52] This corresponds to burial depths of 15 to 150 meters (49 to 492Â ft), and is characterized by generation of carbon dioxide, increased alkalinity and precipitation of calcium carbonate. [53] However, there is some evidence that formation continues well into the methanogenic zone beneath the sulfate reduction zone. [54] [38] [42] A spectacular example of boulder septarian concretions, which are as much as 3 meters (9.8 feet) in diameter, are the Moeraki Boulders . These concretions are found eroding out of Paleocene mudstone of the Moeraki Formation exposed along the coast near Moeraki , South Island , New Zealand . They are composed of calcite-cemented mud with septarian veins of calcite and rare late-stage quartz and ferrous dolomite . [55] [56] [57] [58] The much smaller septarian concretions found in the Kimmeridge Clay exposed in cliffs along the Wessex coast of England are more typical examples of septarian concretions. [59]",

Similar cannonball concretions, which are as much as 4 to 6Â m (13 to 20Â ft) in diameter, are found associated with sandstone outcrops of the Frontier Formation in northeast Utah and central Wyoming . They formed by the early cementation of sand by calcite.

Large and spherical boulders are also found along Koekohe beach near Moeraki on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand . [61] The Moeraki Boulders , Ward Beach boulders and Koutu Boulders of New Zealand are examples of septarian concretions, which are also cannonball concretions. Large spherical rocks, which are found on the shore of Lake Huron near Kettle Point, Ontario , and locally known as \"kettles\" , are typical cannonball concretions.

        "text": "Hiatus concretions are distinguished by their stratigraphic history of exhumation, exposure and reburial. They are found where submarine erosion has concentrated early diagenetic concretions as lag surfaces by washing away surrounding fine-grained sediments. [64] Their significance for stratigraphy, sedimentology and paleontology was first noted by Voigt who referred to them as Hiatus-Konkretionen . [65] \"Hiatus\" refers to the break in sedimentation that allowed this erosion and exposure. They are found throughout the fossil record but are most common during periods in which calcite sea conditions prevailed, such as the Ordovician , Jurassic and Cretaceous . [64] Most are formed from the cemented infillings of burrow systems in siliciclastic or carbonate sediments. A distinctive feature of hiatus concretions separating them from other types is that they were often encrusted by marine organisms including bryozoans , echinoderms and tube worms in the Paleozoic [66] and bryozoans, oysters and tube worms in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Hiatus concretions are also often significantly bored by worms and bivalves. [67]",

These concretions range in shape from spheres to discs, buttons, spiked balls, cylindrical forms, and other odd shapes. They range from pea-size to baseball-size. [72] [73] The concretions were created by the precipitation of iron, which was dissolved in groundwater. The iron was originally present as a thin film of iron oxide surrounding sand grains in the Navajo Sandstone. Groundwater containing methane or petroleum from underlying rock beds reacted with the iron oxide, converting it to soluble reduced iron . When the iron-bearing groundwater came into contact with more oxygen-rich groundwater, the reduced iron was converted back to insoluble iron oxide, which formed the concretions. [72] [73] [74] It is possible that reduced iron first formed siderite concretions that were subsequently oxidized. Iron-oxidizing bacteria may have played a role. [75]",

        "text": "Kansas pop rocks are concretions of either iron sulfide, i.e. pyrite and marcasite , or in some cases jarosite , which are found in outcrops of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation within Gove County, Kansas . They are typically associated with thin layers of altered volcanic ash, called bentonite , that occur within the chalk comprising the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. A few of these concretions enclose, at least in part, large flattened valves of inoceramid bivalves . These concretions range in size from a few millimeters to as much as 0.7Â m (2.3Â ft) in length and 12Â cm (0.39Â ft) in thickness. Most of these concretions are oblate spheroids . Other \"pop rocks\" are small polycuboid pyrite concretions, which are as much as 7Â cm (0.23Â ft) in diameter. These concretions are called \"pop rocks\" because they explode if thrown in a fire. Also, when they are either cut or hammered, they produce sparks and a burning sulfur smell. Contrary to what has been published on the Internet, none of the iron sulfide concretions, which are found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member were created by either the replacement of fossils or by metamorphic processes. In fact, metamorphic rocks are completely absent from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. [76] Instead, all of these iron sulfide concretions were created by the precipitation of iron sulfides within anoxic marine calcareous ooze after it had accumulated and before it had lithified into chalk. Iron sulfide concretions, such as the Kansas Pop rocks, consisting of either pyrite and marcasite , are nonmagnetic. [77] On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either pyrrhotite or smythite , will be magnetic to varying degrees. [78] Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite concretion will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the concretion to become slightly magnetic.",
