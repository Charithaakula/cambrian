        "text": "Around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage. [57] Between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions. Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain , but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause so-called global dimming . After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature. [58] [59] [60] Ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years. [61] Multiple independent datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature, [62] at a rate of around 0.2 °C per decade. [63] The 2013–2022 decade warmed to an average 1.15 °C [1.00–1.25 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900). [64] Not every single year was warmer than the last: internal climate variability processes can make any year 0.2 °C warmer or colder than the average. [65] From 1998 to 2013, negative phases of two such processes, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) [66] and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) [67] caused a so-called \" global warming hiatus \". [68] After the hiatus, the opposite occurred, with years like 2023 exhibiting temperatures well above even the recent average. [69] This is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20-year average, which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns, and detects the long-term signal. [70] : 5 [71] A wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming. [72] [73] The upper atmosphere is cooling, because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface, and so less heat is radiating into space. [74] Warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers . At the same time, warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans , leading to more atmospheric humidity , more and heavier precipitation . [75] [76] Plants are flowering earlier in spring, and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas. [77]",

        "text": "The World Meteorological Organization estimates a 66% chance of global temperatures exceeding 1.5 °C warming from the preindustrial baseline for at least one year between 2023 and 2027. [94] [95] Because the IPCC uses a 20-year average to define global temperature changes, a single year exceeding 1.5 °C does not break the limit. The IPCC expects the 20-year average global temperature to exceed +1.5 °C in the early 2030s. [96] The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2023) included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1.0-1.8 °C under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases , 2.1-3.5 °C under an intermediate emissions scenario , \nor 3.3-5.7 °C under a very high emissions scenario . [97] In the intermediate and high emission scenarios, the warming will continue past 2100. [98] [99] The remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases. [100] According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO 2 . This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions.  There are high uncertainties about the budget. For instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent smaller due to CO 2 and methane release from permafrost and wetlands . [101] However, it is clear that fossil fuel resources need to be proactively kept in the ground to prevent substantial warming. Otherwise, their shortages would not occur until the emissions have already locked in significant long-term impacts. [102]",

For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling. [103] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale. [104] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings . [105] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , solar luminosity , volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun. [106] To determine the human contribution to climate change, unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability . [107] For example, solar forcing—whose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphere—is ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed. [108] Atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller, cooling effect. Other drivers, such as changes in albedo , are less impactful. [109]",

        "text": "Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight , and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface. The Earth radiates it as heat , and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time. [115] While water vapour (≈50%) and clouds (≈25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity . On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO 2 (≈20%), tropospheric ozone , [116] CFCs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature, and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures. [117] Before the Industrial Revolution , naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence. [118] [119] Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels ( coal , oil , and natural gas ), [120] has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance . In 2019, the concentrations of CO 2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750. [121] These CO 2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years. Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years. [122] Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO 2 . Of these emissions, 75% was CO 2 , 18% was methane , 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases . [123] CO 2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport , manufacturing, heating , and electricity. [5] Additional CO 2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes , which include the CO 2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement , steel , aluminum , and fertiliser . [124] [125] [126] [127] Methane emissions come from livestock , manure, rice cultivation , landfills, wastewater, and coal mining , as well as oil and gas extraction . [128] [129] Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser . [130] [131] While methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years, [132] CO 2 lasts much longer. The Earth's surface absorbs CO2 as part of the carbon cycle . While plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of CO 2 every year, that CO 2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested, burns, or decays. [133] Land-surface carbon sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO 2 emissions. [134] The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO 2 over the last 2 decades. [135] CO 2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the Earth's crust, which is a process that can take millions of years to complete. [133]",

        "text": "According to Food and Agriculture Organization , around 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans ( glaciers , deserts , etc.), 26% is forests , 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land . [137] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, [138] as the destroyed trees release CO 2 , and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink . [32] Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock. Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems. 26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23%. [139] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts. Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink. [140] Local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space ( albedo ), and how much heat is lost by evaporation . For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. [141] In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler. [140] At latitudes closer to the poles, there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered (and more reflective) plains. [141] Globally, these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change. Thus, land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect. [142]",

[152] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites , [159] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards. [152] Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere ). [160] The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere ) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling. [108] This is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere. [161] Explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases, dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures, or they can send water vapor into the atmosphere, which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures. [162] These impacts on temperature only last for several years, because both water vapor and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere. [163] volcanic CO 2 emissions are more persistent, but they are equivalent to less than 1% of current human-caused CO 2 emissions. [164] Volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact (forcing) on temperature in the industrial era. Yet, like the other natural forcings, it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the Industrial Revolution. [163]",

        "text": "The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by \"self-reinforcing\" or \"positive\" feedbacks and reduced by \"balancing\" or \"negative\" feedbacks . [166] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback , the ice–albedo feedback , and the net effect of clouds. [167] [168] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling , as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature. [169] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilising effect of CO 2 on plant growth. [170] Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivty. [171] Radiative feedbacks are physical processes that influence the rate of global warming in response to warming. For instance, warmer air can hold more moisture , and water vapour itself is a potent greenhouse gas. [167] Warmer air can also result in clouds becoming higher and thinner, where they act as an insulator and warm the planet. [172] Another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, reducing the reflectivity of the Earth's surface there and contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes . [173] [174] Arctic amplification is also thawing permafrost , which releases methane and CO 2 into the atmosphere. [175] Around half of human-caused CO 2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans. [176] This fraction is not static and if future CO 2 emissions decrease, the Earth will be able to absorb up to around 70%. If they increase substantially, it'll still absorb more carbon than now, but the overall fraction will decrease to below 40%. [177] This is because climate change increases droughts and heat waves that eventually inhibit plant growth on land, and soils will release more carbon from dead plants when they are warmer . [178] [179] The rate at which oceans absorb atmospheric carbon will be lowered as they become more acidic and experience changes in thermohaline circulation and phytoplankton distribution. [180] [181] [89] Uncertainty over feedbacks, particularly cloud cover, [182] is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.

[184] Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing. [185] Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks . [186] [187] Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere. [188] The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates. [189] Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage [190] and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase. [191] Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations. [192] The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\". [193] Additionally, climate models may be unable to adequately predict short-term regional climatic shifts. [194] A subset of climate models add societal factors to a physical climate model. These models simulate how population, economic growth , and energy use affect—and interact with—the physical climate. With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change. [195] [196] Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm. [197]",

        "text": "The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans , ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations. [198] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. [199] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia. [200] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980. [201] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing , [202] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming. [203] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change. [204] Global sea level is rising as a consequence of thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets . Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year. [206] Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects 32–62 cm of sea level rise under a low emission scenario, 44–76 cm under an intermediate one and 65–101 cm under a very high emission scenario. [207] Marine ice sheet instability processes in Antarctica may add substantially to these values, [208] including the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions. [209] Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice . [210] While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C. [211] Higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations cause more CO 2 to dissolve in the oceans, which is making them more acidic . [212] Because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water, [213] its concentrations in the ocean are decreasing , and dead zones are expanding. [214]",

        "text": "Greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ' tipping points '—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state. [217] [218] For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears. If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place. [219] While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond. The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades. [216] The long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming , sea level rise, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation. [220] The timescale of long-term impacts are centuries to millennia due to CO 2 's long atmospheric lifetime. [221] When net emissions stabilise surface air temperatures will also stabilise, but oceans and ice caps will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere. The result is an estimated total sea level rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2 ft/°F) after 2000 years.

[223] Deep oceans (below 2,000 metres (6,600 ft)) are also already committed to losing over 10% of their dissolved oxygen by the warming which occurred to date. [224] Further, the West Antarctic ice sheet appears committed to practically irreversible melting, which would increase the sea levels by at least 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in) over approximately 2000 years.

        "text": "Climate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. [283] In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target. [101] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry. [284] The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2 °C. An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5 °C goal. [285] With pledges made under the Paris Agreement as of October 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7 °C (range: 2.2–3.2 °C) by the end of the century. [24] Globally, limiting warming to 2 °C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs. [286] Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °C, [287] most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions. [288] To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, [289] such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation . [290] Other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk. Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century. [291] There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts. [292] Solar radiation modification (SRM) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions. However, SRM raises significant ethical and legal concerns, and the risks are imperfectly understood. [293]",

        "text": "Renewable energy is key to limiting climate change. [295] For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use. [296] The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower , bioenergy , wind and solar power and geothermal energy ). [297] Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions. [298] Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind. [299] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply. However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison. [300] While solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations, [301] green energy policies are needed to achieve a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables. [302] To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050. [303] [304] Electricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport. [305] Transport can switch away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electric vehicles , public transit, and active transport (cycling and walking). [306] [307] For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels would reduce emissions. [306] Heating could be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps . [308] There are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables. For wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects. [309] Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability . Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low. Going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs. [295] Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security. [310] The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around radioactive waste , nuclear weapon proliferation , and accidents . [311] [312] Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns. [313] Low-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change as well as reducing air pollution deaths, [314] which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016. [315] Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2 °C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty. [316] Improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs. [317]",

These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. [327] On the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets . [328] Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use. [329] Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation. [330] Steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO 2 emissions. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO 2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries. [331]",

[332] Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns. [333] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops , reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage , and using compost and manure as soil amendments. [334] Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction. [140] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter. [335] [336] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems. [337] Where energy production or CO 2 -intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO 2 , the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere. Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, [338] carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO 2 emissions by mid-century. [339] This technique, in combination with bioenergy ( BECCS ) can result in net negative emissions as CO 2 is drawn from the atmosphere. [340] It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5 °C. Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals. [341]",

The connection is recognised in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\". [359] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation. [360] The geopolitics of climate change is complex. It has often been framed as a free-rider problem , in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves. Sometimes mitigation also has localised benefits though. For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions. [361] Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets : fossil fuels they cannot sell. [362]",

        "text": "Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [375] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. [376] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained. [377] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do. Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed. [378] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations. [379] The 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions. [380] During the negotiations, the G77 (representing developing countries ) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions, [381] since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs. [382] The 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77. [383] Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 °C. [384] The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund . [385] As of 2020 [update] , only 83.3 billion were delivered. Only in 2023 the target is expected to be achieved. [386] In 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement , which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0 °C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5 °C . [387] The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement. Instead, a set of procedures was made binding. Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years. [388] The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported. [389] As of October 2021 [update] , 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement. [390] The 1987 Montreal Protocol , an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so. [391] The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons , a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases. This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change. [392]",

[65] [66] To deliver reliable electricity from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, electrical power systems must be flexible. [67] Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. [68] The integration of larger amounts of solar and wind energy into the grid requires a change of the energy system; this is necessary to ensure that the supply of electricity matches demand. [69] There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale. There is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low. [69] Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines also makes it possible to reduce variability. [70] It is possible to shift energy demand in time. Energy demand management and the use of smart grids make it possible to match the times when variable energy production is highest. [69] Sector coupling can provide further flexibility. This involves coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat -systems and electric vehicles. [71] Energy storage helps overcome barriers to intermittent renewable energy. [72] The most commonly used and available storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity . This requires locations with large differences in height and access to water. [72] Batteries are also in wide use. [73] They typically store electricity for short periods. [74] Batteries have  low energy density . This and their cost makes them impractical for the large energy storage necessary to balance inter-seasonal variations in energy production. [75] Some locations have implemented pumped hydro storage with capacity for multi-month usage. [76]",

In transport and electricity production, fossil fuel usage has a low efficiency of less than 50%. Large amounts of heat in power plants and in motors of vehicles go to waste. The actual amount of energy consumed is significantly lower at 116,000 TWh. [98] Energy conservation is the effort made to reduce the consumption of energy by using less of an energy service. One way is to use energy more efficiently . This means using less energy than before to produce the same service. Another way is to reduce the amount of service used. An example of this would be to drive less. Energy conservation is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy . [99] When consumers reduce wastage and losses they can conserve energy. The upgrading of technology as well as the improvements to operations and maintenance can result in overall efficiency improvements. Efficient energy use (or energy efficiency ) is the process of reducing the amount of energy required to provide products and services. Improved energy efficiency in buildings (\"green buildings\"), industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third. This would help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. [100] For example, insulating a building allows it to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain thermal comfort. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process. [101] Another way is to use commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.",

Almost 15% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have been attributed to the livestock sector. [108] A shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate climate change.

Scientists call this process also carbon sequestration . In the context of climate change mitigation, the IPCC defines a sink as \"Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere\". [13] : 2249 Globally, the two most important carbon sinks are vegetation and the ocean . [123] To enhance the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon, changes are necessary in agriculture and forestry. [124] Examples are preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation .

A high mitigation potential is found for reducing deforestation in tropical regions. The economic potential of these activities has been estimated to be 4.2 to 7.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO 2 -eq) per year. [7] : 37",

[130] One forest conservation strategy is to transfer rights over land from public ownership to its indigenous inhabitants. [131] Land concessions often go to powerful extractive companies.

This is because the native inhabitants turn to work for extractive companies to survive. [132] Proforestation is promoting forests to capture their full ecological potential. [133] This is a mitigation strategy as secondary forests that have regrown in abandoned farmland are found to have less biodiversity than the original old-growth forests .

Scenarios for new plantations covering up to 4000 million hectares (Mha) (6300 x 6300 km) suggest cumulative carbon storage of more than 900 GtC (2300 GtCO 2 ) until 2100. [137] But they are not a viable alternative to aggressive emissions reduction. [138] This is because the plantations would need to be so large they would eliminate most natural ecosystems or reduce food production. [139] One example is the Trillion Tree Campaign . [140] [141] However, preserving biodiversity is also important and for example not all grasslands are suitable for conversion into forests. [142] Grasslands can even turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources . [143] Reforestation is the restocking of existing depleted forests or in places where there were recently forests. Reforestation could save at least 1 GtCO 2 per year, at an estimated cost of $5–15 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO 2 ). [146] Restoring all degraded forests all over the world could capture about 205 GtC (750 GtCO 2 ). [147] With increased intensive agriculture and urbanization , there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every acre of original old-growth forest cut down, more than 50 acres of new secondary forests are growing. [134] [148] In some countries, promoting regrowth on abandoned farmland could offset years of emissions. [149] Planting new trees can be expensive and a risky investment. For example, about 80 percent of planted trees in the Sahel die within two years. [144] Reforestation has higher carbon storage potential than afforestation. Even long-deforested areas still contain an \"underground forest\" of living roots and tree stumps. Helping native species sprout naturally is cheaper than planting new trees and they are more likely to survive. This could include pruning and coppicing to accelerate growth. This also provides woodfuel, which is otherwise a major source of deforestation. Such practices, called farmer-managed natural regeneration , are centuries old but the biggest obstacle towards implementation is ownership of the trees by the state. The state often sells timber rights to businesses which leads to locals uprooting seedlings because they see them as a liability. Legal aid for locals [150] [151] and changes to property law such as in Mali and Niger have led to significant changes. Scientists describe them as the largest positive environmental transformation in Africa. It is possible to discern from space the border between Niger and the more barren land in Nigeria, where the law has not changed. [144] [145]",

These could reduce CO 2 emissions and lower existing atmospheric CO 2 levels. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing CO 2 from large point sources , such as cement factories or biomass power plants. It then stores it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS. [183] Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) expands on the potential of CCS and aims to lower atmospheric CO 2 levels. This process uses biomass grown for bioenergy . The biomass yields energy in useful forms such as electricity, heat, biofuels, etc. through consumption of the biomass via combustion, fermentation, or pyrolysis. The process captures the CO 2 that was extracted from the atmosphere when it grew. It then stores it underground or via land application as biochar . This effectively removes it from the atmosphere . [184] This makes BECCS a negative emissions technology (NET). [185] Scientists estimated the potential range of negative emissions from BECCS in 2018 as 0–22 Gt per year. [186] As of 2022 [update] , BECCS was capturing approximately 2 million tonnes per year of CO 2 annually. [187] The cost and availability of biomass limits wide deployment of BECCS. [188] [189] : 10 BECCS currently forms a big part of achieving climate targets beyond 2050 in modelling, such as by the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) associated with the IPCC process. But many scientists are sceptical due to the risk of loss of biodiversity. [190] Direct air capture is a process of capturing CO 2 directly from the ambient air. This is in contrast to CCS which captures carbon from point sources. It generates a concentrated stream of CO 2 for sequestration , utilization or production of carbon-neutral fuel and windgas . [191] Artificial processes vary, and there are concerns about the long-term effects of some of these processes. [192] [ obsolete source ]",

By 2020, aviation emissions were 70% higher than in 2005 and they could grow by 300% by 2050. [224] It is possible to reduce aviation's environmental footprint by better fuel economy in aircraft . Optimising flight routes to lower non-CO 2 effects on climate from nitrogen oxides, particulates or contrails can also help. Aviation biofuel , carbon emission trading and carbon offsetting , part of the 191 nation ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), can lower CO 2 emissions. Short-haul flight bans , train connections, personal choices and taxation on flights can lead to fewer flights.

Important mitigation options for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock include genetic selection, [230] [231] introduction of methanotrophic bacteria into the rumen, [232] [233] vaccines, feeds, [234] diet modification and grazing management.

However, an oversupply of allowances keeps most ETS at low price levels around $10 with a low impact. This includes the Chinese ETS which started with $7/tCO 2 in 2021. [302] One exception is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme where prices began to rise in 2018. They reached about €80/tCO 2 in 2022.

Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a grid, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro.

[30] The loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir. [46] Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks. [47] The turbines also will kill large portions of the fauna passing through, for instance 70% of the eel passing a turbine will perish immediately.

According to the World Commission on Dams report, [57] where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.

In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

[52] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions , geographic location and time of day. [53] There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal , which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity. [12] PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022. [54] It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, [55] compared to 25 GW of solar thermal. [54] Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building. Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments. China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013. Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19 , growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines. Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.

[60] PV has several advantages that make it by far the fastest-growing renewable energy technology. It is cheap, low-maintenance and scalable; adding to an existing PV installation as demanded arises is simple. Its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather. [12] PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station . [61] A household's solar panels can either be used for just that household or, if connected to an electrical grid, can be aggregated with millions of others. [62] The first utility-scale solar power plant was built in 1982 in Hesperia, California by ARCO . [63] The plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later. [64] However, over the following decades, PV cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper. [65] As a result, PV adoption has grown exponentially since 2010. [66] Global capacity increased from 230 GW at the end of 2015 to 890 GW in 2021. [67] PV grew fastest in China between 2016 and 2021, adding 560 GW, more than all advanced economies combined.

        "text": "Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC. Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps. Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy. [82] There are many forms of water energy: Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar. [86] In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,360 GW. [68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol. Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 [98] and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention . Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [205] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal .

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

[259] Although protests against new wind farms occasionally occur around the world, regional and national surveys generally find broad support for both solar and wind power. [260] [261] [262] Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms. [263] A 2011 UK Government document stated that \"projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake.\" [264] In the 2000s and early 2010s, many renewable projects in Germany, Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities, particularly through cooperative structures. [265] [266] In the years since, more installations in Germany have been undertaken by large companies, [263] but community ownership remains strong in Denmark. [267]",

        "text": "Global warming affects all parts of Earth's climate system . [15] Global surface temperatures have risen by 1.1 °C (2.0 °F). Scientists say they will rise further in the future. [16] [17] The changes in climate are not uniform across the Earth. In particular, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas. The Arctic is warming faster than most other regions. [1] Night-time temperatures have increased faster than daytime temperatures. [18] The impact on nature and people depends on how much more the Earth warms. [19] : 787 Scientists use several methods to predict the effects of human-caused climate change. One is to investigate past natural changes in climate. [20] To assess changes in Earth's past climate scientists have studied tree rings , ice cores , corals , and ocean and lake sediments . [21] These show that recent temperatures have surpassed anything in the last 2,000 years. [22] By the end of the 21st century, temperatures may increase to a level last seen in the mid-Pliocene . This was around 3 million years ago. [23] : 322 At that time, mean global temperatures were about 2–4 °C (3.6–7.2 °F) warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. The global mean sea level was up to 25 metres (82 ft) higher than it is today. [24] : 323 The modern observed rise in temperature and CO 2 concentrations has been rapid. even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do not approach current rates. [25] : 54 How much the world warms depends on human greenhouse gas emissions and on how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gases . [26] The more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is emitted in the 21st century the hotter the world will be by 2100. For a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations, the global mean temperature would rise by about 2.5–4 °C (4.5–7.2 °F). [27] If emissions of CO 2 stopped abruptly and there was no use of negative emission technologies , the Earth's climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state. Temperatures would stay at the same high level for several centuries. After about a thousand years, 20% to 30% of human-emitted CO 2 would remain in the atmosphere. The ocean and land would not have taken  them. This would commit the climate to a warmer state long after emissions have stopped. [28] With current mitigation policies the temperature will be about 2.7 °C (2.0–3.6 °C) above pre-industrial levels by 2100. It would rise by 2.4 °C (4.3 °F) if governments achieved all their unconditional pledges and targets. If all the countries that have set or are considering net-zero targets achieve them, the temperature will rise by around 1.8 °C (3.2 °F). There is a big gap between national plans and commitments and the actions that governments have taken around the world. [29]",

Heat waves are more likely to occur simultaneously with droughts. Marine heatwaves are twice as likely as they were in 1980. [42] Climate change will lead to more very hot days and fewer very cold days. [43] : 7 There are fewer cold waves . [40] : 8 Experts can often attribute the intensity of individual heat waves to global warming. Some extreme events would have been nearly impossible without human influence on the climate system. A heatwave that would occur once every ten years before global warming started now occurs 2.8 times as often. Under further warming, heatwaves are set to become more frequent. An event that would occur every ten years would occur every other year if global warming reaches 2 °C (3.6 °F). [44] Heat stress is related to temperature. It also increases if humidity is higher. The wet-bulb temperature measures both temperature and humidity. Humans cannot adapt to a wet-bulb temperature above 35 °C (95 °F). This heat stress can kill people. If global warming is kept below 1.5 or 2 °C (2.7 or 3.6 °F), it will probably be possible to avoid this deadly heat and humidity in most of the tropics. But there may still be negative health impacts. [45] [46] There is some evidence climate change is leading to a weakening of the polar vortex . This would make the jet stream more wavy. [47] This would lead to outbursts of very cold winter weather across parts of Eurasia [48] and North America and incursions of very warm air into the Arctic. [49] [50] [51]",

When a fire starts in an area with very dry vegetation, it can spread rapidly. Higher temperatures can also lengthen the fire season. This is the time of year in which severe wildfires are most likely, particularly in regions where snow is disappearing. [68] Weather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires. But the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased. This is mostly because savanna has been converted to cropland , so there are fewer trees to burn. Prescribed burning is an indigenous practice in the US and Australia. It can reduce wildfire burning.

This ice-albedo feedback is a self-reinforcing feedback of climate change. [100] Large-scale measurements of sea ice have only been possible since satellites came into use. [101] Sea ice in the Arctic has declined in recent decades in area and volume due to climate change. It has been melting more in summer than it refreezes in winter. The decline of sea ice in the Arctic has been accelerating during the early twenty-first century. It has a rate of decline  of 4.7% per decade. It has declined over 50% since the first satellite records. [102] [103] [104] Ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) degrees of warming.

Only change in land use and sea use and direct exploitation of organisms had a bigger impact. [112] The impacts of climate change on nature are likely to become bigger in the next few decades.

They threaten substantial damage to unique ecosystems. They can even result in their complete loss and the extinction of species. [114] [115] This can disrupt key interactions between species within ecosystems. This is because species from one location do not leave the warming habitat at the same rate. The result is rapid changes in the way the ecosystem functions. [9] Impacts include changes in regional rainfall patterns. Another is earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions. Movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes, [116] changes in bird migrations, and shifting of the oceans' plankton and fish from cold- to warm-adapted communities are other impacts. [117] These changes of land and ocean ecosystems have direct effects on human well-being. [118] [119] : 385 For instance, ocean ecosystems help with coastal protection and provide food.

[120] : 239 Beyond 2050, climate change may be the major cause of biodiversity loss globally. [120] : 239 Climate change interacts with other pressures. These include habitat modification, pollution and invasive species . Through this interaction, climate change increases the risk of extinction for many terrestrial and freshwater species. [121] At 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) of warming (around 2023 [122] ) some ecosystems are threatened by mass die-offs of trees and from heatwaves. [123] At 2 °C (3.6 °F) of warming, around 10% of species on land would become critically endangered. This differs by group. For instance insects and salamanders are more vulnerable. [11] : 259 Rainfall on the Amazon rainforest is recycled when it evaporates back into the atmosphere instead of running off away from the rainforest. This water is essential for sustaining the rainforest. Due to deforestation the rainforest is losing this ability. This effect is even worse because  climate change brings more frequent droughts to the area. The higher frequency of droughts in the first two decades of the 21st century and other data signal that a tipping point from rainforest to savanna might be close. A 2019 study concluded that this ecosystem could begin a 50-year-long collapse to a savanna around 2021. After that it would become increasingly and disproportionally more difficult to prevent or reverse this shift. [125] [126] [127]",

These include ecosystems, ice sheets, and the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere. [138] Tipping points are studied using data from Earth's distant past and by physical modeling. [136] There is already moderate risk of global tipping points at 1 °C (1.8 °F) above pre-industrial temperatures. That becomes a high risk  at 2.5 °C (4.5 °F).

Examples are the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, the Amazon rainforest, and warm-water coral reefs. [139] Tipping points are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of future climate change, potentially leading to irreversible impacts on society. [140] A collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation would likely halve rainfall in India and lead to severe drops in temperature in Northern Europe.

Estimates of the number of people at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea level rise vary. Estimates range from 190 million [188] to 300 million. It could even be 640 million in a worst-case scenario related to the instability of the Antarctic ice sheet.

Climate impacts such as desertification and rising sea levels gradually erode livelihoods. They force communities to abandon traditional homelands. Other forms of migration are adaptive and voluntary. They are based on individual or household decisions. [210] : 1079 On the other hand, some households may fall into poverty or get poorer due to climate change. This limits their ability to move to less affected areas. [211] Migration due to climate and weather is usually within countries. But it is long-distance. Slow-onset disasters such as droughts and heat are more likely to cause long-term migration than weather disasters like floods. [211] Migration due to desertification and reduced soil fertility is typically from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities.

There is increasing consensus among experts that climate change increases the risk for intrastate conflicts, such as civil wars , communal violence , or protests . [217] The most recent IPCC report concludes: \" Climate hazards have affected armed conflict within countries (medium confidence), but the influence of climate is small compared to socio-economic, political, and cultural factors (high confidence).\" [218] Climate change can increase conflict risks by causing tensions about scarce resources like food, water and land, by weakening state institutions, by reducing the opportunity costs for impoverished individuals to join armed groups, and by causing tensions related to (climate-induced) migration. [219] [218] Recently, experts have expressed concerns that efforts to mitigate or adapt to climate change can also cause conflicts, for instance due to higher food and energy prices or when people are forcibly re-located from vulnerable areas. [220] [221] Research has shown that climate change is not the most important conflict driver, and that it can only affect conflict risks under certain circumstances. [217] Relevant context factors include agricultural dependence, a history of political instability, poverty, and the political exclusion of ethnic groups. [222] [223] [224] Climate change has thus been described as a \"threat multiplier\". [225] Yet, an impact of climate change on specific conflicts like the Syrian civil war [226] [227] or the armed conflict in Darfur [228] [229] remains hard to proof. In some cases, climate change could also decrease conflict risks. This happens either if climate-related disasters impose financial and logistical constraints on conflict parties [224] [230] or if various social groups come together to cooperate about the shared challenge of climate change ( environmental peacebuilding ).

[234] Economic modelling may underrate the impact of catastrophic climatic changes. When estimating losses, economists choose a discount rate . This determines how much one prefers to have goods or cash now compared to at a future date. Using a high discount rate may understate economic losses. This is because losses for future generations weigh less heavily. [235] Economic impacts are bigger the more the temperature rises. [236] Scientists have compared impacts with warming of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and a level of 3.66 °C (6.59 °F). They use this higher figure to represent no efforts to stop emissions. They found that total damages at 1.5 °C were 90% less than at 3.66 °C. [133] : 256 One study found that global GDP at the end of the century would be 3.5% less if warming is limited to 3 °C (5.4 °F). This study excludes the potential effect of tipping points . Another study found that excluding tipping points underestimates the global economic impact by a factor of two to eight. [133] : 256 Another study found that a temperature rise of 2 °C (3.6 °F) by 2050 would reduce global GDP by 2.5%–7.5%. By 2100 in this scenario the temperature would rise by 4 °C (7.2 °F). This could reduce global GDP by 30% in the worst case. [237] Global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s. [111] : 110 Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses. These factors include population growth and increased wealth. [238] Regional climatic factors also play a role. These include changes in precipitation and flooding events. It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend. [239] The trend does suggest social systems are increasing vulnerable to climate change. [239]",

        "text": "In Africa , future population growth amplifies risks from sea level rise. Some 54.2 million people lived in the highly exposed low elevation coastal zones (LECZ) around 2000. This number will effectively double to around 110 million people by 2030. By 2060 it will be around 185 to 230 million people, depending on the extent of population growth. The average regional sea level rise will be around 21 cm by 2060. At that point climate change scenarios will make little difference. But local geography and population trends interact to increase the exposure to hazards like 100-year floods in a complex way. [26] In the near term, some of the largest displacement is projected to occur in the East Africa region. At least 750,000 people there are likely to be displaced from the coasts between 2020 and 2050. Scientific studies estimate that 12 major African cities would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the \"moderate\" climate change scenario RCP4.5 by 2050. These cities are Abidjan , Alexandria , Algiers , Cape Town , Casablanca , Dakar , Dar es Salaam , Durban , Lagos , Lomé , Luanda and Maputo . Under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 the damage would amount to US$86.5 billion. The version of the high-emission scenario with additional impacts from high ice sheet instability would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. The damage from these three scenarios accounting additionally for \"low-probability, high-damage events\" would rise to US$187 billion, US$206 billion and US$397 billion respectively. [26] In these estimates, the Egyptian city of Alexandria alone accounts for around half of this figure. [26] Hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already need relocation in the coming decade. [27] Across sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, damage from sea level rise could reach 2–4% of GDP by 2050. However this figure depends on the extent of future economic growth and adaptation . [26] In the longer term, Egypt , Mozambique and Tanzania are likely to have the largest number of people affected by annual flooding amongst all African countries. This projection assumes global warming will reach 4 °C by the end of the century. That rise is associated with the RCP8.5 scenario. Under RCP8.5, 10 important cultural sites would be at risk of flooding and erosion by the end of the century. These are the Casbah of Algiers , Carthage Archaeological site , Kerkouane , Leptis Magna Archaeological site , Medina of Sousse , Medina of Tunis , Sabratha Archaeological site , Robben Island , Island of Saint-Louis and Tipasa .  A total of 15 Ramsar sites and other natural heritage sites would face similar risks. These are Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve , Delta du Saloum National Park , Diawling National Park , Golfe de Boughrara , Kalissaye , Lagune de Ghar el Melh et Delta de la Mejerda , Marromeu Game Reserve , Parc Naturel des Mangroves du Fleuve Cacheu , Seal Ledges Provincial Nature Reserve , Sebkhet Halk Elmanzel et Oued Essed , Sebkhet Soliman , Réserve Naturelle d'Intérêt Communautaire de la Somone , Songor Biosphere Reserve , Tanbi Wetland Complex and Watamu Marine National Park .

        "text": "Climate change will increasingly impact Africa due to many factors. These impacts are already being felt and will increase in magnitude if action is not taken to reduce global carbon emissions. The impacts include higher temperatures, drought, changing rainfall patterns, and increased climate variability. These conditions have a bearing on energy production and consumption. The recent drought in many African countries , which has been linked to climate change, adversely affected both energy security and economic growth across the continent. Africa will be one of the regions most impacted by the adverse effects of climate change. [29] Reasons for Africa's vulnerability are diverse and include low levels of adaptive capacity, poor diffusion of technologies and information relevant to supporting adaptation, and high dependence on agro-ecosystems for livelihoods. [30] Many countries across Africa are classified as Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) with poor socio-economic conditions, and by implication are faced with particular challenges in responding to the impacts of climate change . [31] Pronounced risks identified for Africa in the IPCC 's Fifth Assessment Report relate to ecosystems, water availability , and agricultural systems, with implications for food security. [29] In 2022, over 6,000 respondents from ten African nations took part in a climate survey conducted by the European Investment Bank . [32] The survey found that 88% of respondents claimed climate change was hurting their lives, while 61% of respondents claimed that environmental destruction has impacted their income or source of livelihood. [33] These losses are usually the result of severe drought , increasing sea levels or coastal erosion , or extreme weather events like floods or storms. [32] More than half of African respondents (57%) said that they or people they know have already made steps to adapt to the effects of climate change. Among these measures are investments in water-saving devices to mitigate the effects of drought and drain clearance ahead of flooding. [32] 34% of all African respondents said climate change is one of the most pressing issues confronting their country, among other key issues such as inflation and access to health care . [32]",

        "section": "Adaptation",
        "text": "To reduce the impacts of climate change on African countries, adaptation measures are required at multiple scales – ranging from local to national and regional levels. [139] The first generation of adaptation projects in Africa can be largely characterized as small-scale in nature, focused on targeted investments in agriculture and diffusion of technologies to support adaptive decision-making. [140] More recently, programming efforts have re-oriented towards larger and more coordinated efforts, tackling issues that spanning multiple sectors. According to a 2023 study, 59% of African banks have a climate change policy in place, with another 22% planning to implement one. 65% of banks presently consider climate risk when evaluating new clients or projects, with another 23% expecting to do so in the future. [141] Improved weather forecasting technology in sub-Saharan Africa is important to inform the response to climate change, [144] to aid decision-making associated with adaptation to climate change for example. [144] During the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) in 2015, African heads of state launched the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The AAI's steering committee is composed of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) Bureau and the chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). [145] The Africa Adaptation Initiative is also supported by the European Union . [146] The European Union has partnered with the African Union on the promotion of sustainable resources management, environmental resilience , and climate change mitigation [147] At the regional level, regional policies and actions in support of adaptation across Africa are still in their infancy. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) highlights examples of various regional climate change action plans, including those developed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Lake Victoria Basin Committee. [29] At the national level, many early adaptation initiatives were coordinated through National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) or National Climate Change Response Strategies (NCCRS). Implementation has been slow however, with mixed success in delivery. [148] Integration of climate change with wider economic and development planning remains limited but growing. [149] [29] At the subnational level, many provincial and municipal authorities are also developing their own strategies, for example the Western Cape Climate Change Response Strategy. [150] Yet, levels of technical capacity and resources available to implement plans are generally low. There has been considerable attention across Africa given to implementing community-based adaptation projects. There is broad agreement that support to local-level adaptation is best achieved by starting with existing local adaptive capacity, and engaging with indigenous knowledge and practices. [151] The IPCC highlights a number of successful approaches to promote effective adaptation in Africa, outlining five common principles. [29] These include: The World Health Organization's report \"Adaptation to Climate Change in Africa Plan of Action for the Health Sector 2012–2016\" [152] is intended to \"provide a comprehensive and evidence-based coordinated response of the health sector to climate change adaptation needs of African countries in order to support the commitments and priorities of African governments.\" [152] The action plan includes goals like scaling up public health activities, coordinating efforts on an international scale, strengthening partnerships and collaborative efforts, and promoting research on both the effects of climate change as well as effective measures taken in local communities to mitigate climate change consequences. [152] According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Sub-Saharan Africa requires $30–$50 billion in additional financing each year to adapt to the effects of climate change. [143] [153] [154] Climate financing in the Middle East and North Africa totaled $32.6 billion (2% of the world total) in 2019/2020, while climate investment in Sub-Saharan Africa was $43.8 billion (3% of the global total). [141] [155] According to the European Investment Bank 's Banking in Africa study 2021, African institutions are becoming more conscious of the need to address the dangers posed by climate change and are beginning to capitalize on possibilities in green financing . For example, 54% of questioned banks in the study saw climate change as a strategic concern, and more than 40% had people focusing on climate-related fronts. [156] Sub-Saharan African banks are growing their digital offerings, which has been expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the banks surveyed said that the pandemic has accelerated the speed of digital transformation , and that this shift will be permanent. [157] [158] [143] The poor and vulnerable are most susceptible, with migrant workers, refugees, and other marginalised groups likely to suffer the most. GDP per capita is not likely to rebound to 2019 levels until 2024, with risks tilting to the downside, and the crisis has reversed a predicted drop in the number of poor people, according to the IMF. In comparison to pre-crisis forecasts, this might result in an additional 30 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa living in extreme poverty by 2021, as well as an additional nine million in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) area. [159] As of 2023, about a third of all African climate funding flows to five major markets: Morocco (7% of African climate investment in 2019/2022), Nigeria (7%), Kenya (7%), Ethiopia (6%), and South Africa (5%). [141] Over the last decade, worldwide greenfield foreign direct investment has declined at a 3% annual rate, with Africa's global contribution dropping from 12% in 2017 to less than 6% in 2021.

        "text": "As of 2000, the largest sectoral contributor to greenhouse gas emissions was the energy sector , whose 58 million tonnes (Mt) of CO 2 equivalent emissions made up 26% of the national total. This was followed by the transport sector with 36 Mt, or 16%. [1] : 7 Other estimates put the energy sector as producing 55% of CO 2 emissions in 2011, and 46% in 2013. [2] Fossil fuels remain the primary fuel for electricity generation. Demand for electricity grew 64% in the decade prior to 2017. In 2017, over 44% of electricity was produced from burning coal , and 38% from natural gas . The 17% produced through renewable energy came almost completely from hydropower , with other renewables producing just 0.5% of electricity. Coal usage has been increasing, overtaking natural gas usage in 2010.  The percentage produced by natural gas has decreased from 57% in 1995, when coal produced only 9%. Most coal is imported, due to the high costs of mining domestic deposits. Much of this change is due to the amount of natural gas being used deliberately being maintained at its 2000 levels, leaving further demand to be taken up by coal as part of diversification. Natural gas production continued to increase, but was diverted to exports. At one point oil was a significant fuel for electricity generation, producing 21% of electricity in 1995, but as oil prices rose this decreased to 2% in 2010 and 0.6% in 2017. [2] Hydropower is concentrated in East Malaysia , although potential also exists in Perak and Pahang . Despite the recent increase in coal use, no new coal capacity is expected under current plans, which instead target natural gas, and to a lesser extent solar and hydropower. CO 2 and CH 4 emissions decreased from 2010 to 2017, during a period of hydropower expansion, while the growth in N 2 O emissions slowed. [2] Short-lived climate pollutants are related to high levels of air pollution in major cities. [1] : 5 Deforestation , particularly for palm oil and natural rubber production, is also a major contributor to the country's greenhouse gas emissions. A 2016 study estimated deforestation and land use change between 2010 and 2015 contributed to 22.1 million Mg annual CO 2 emissions. [3]",

For example, Australia 's farmers are very likely to suffer losses during the El Nino weather conditions, while 2003 European heat wave led to 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses. [21] Climate change is known to increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves , and to make precipitation less predictable and more prone to extremes, but since climate change attribution is still a relatively new field, connecting specific weather events and the shortfalls they cause to climate change over natural variability is often difficult. Exceptions include West Africa , where the climate-induced intensification of extreme weather was found to have already decreased millet yields by 10–20%, and sorghum yields 5–15%. Similarly, it was found that climate change had intensified drought conditions in Southern Africa in 2007, which elevated food prices and caused \"acute food insecurity\" in the country of Lesotho . Agriculture in Southern Africa was also adversely affected by drought after climate change intensified the effects of 2014–2016 El Niño event . [5] : 724 In Europe , between 1950 and 2019, heat extremes have become more frequent and also more likely to occur consecutively, while cold extremes have declined. At the same time, Northern Europe and much of Eastern Europe was found to experience extreme precipitation more often, while the Mediterranean became more affected by drought . [22] Similarly, the severity of heatwave and drought effects on European crop production was found to have tripled over a 50-year period – from losses of 2.2% during 1964–1990 to losses of 7.3% in 1991–2015. [23] [19] In the summer of 2018, heat waves probably linked to climate change greatly reduced average yield in many parts of the world, especially Europe. During the month of August, more crop failures resulted in a rise in global food prices . [24] On the other hand, floods, often linked to climate change, have also had notable adverse effects on agriculture in the recent years. In May 2019, floods shortened corn planting season in the Midwestern United States , lowering the projected yield from 15 billion bushels to 14.2. [25] During the 2021 European floods , estimates pointed to severe damage to the agricultural sector of Belgium, one of the countries hardest hit by the floods, including long-term effects like soil erosion . [26] In China , 2023 research found that extreme rainfall had cost the country about 8% of its rice output over the two preceding decades. This was considered comparable to losses caused by extreme heat over this period. [27]",

[30] The current prediction is that temperatures will increase and precipitation will decrease in arid and semi-arid regions ( Middle East , Africa , Australia , Southwest United States , and Southern Europe ). [30] [31] In addition, crop yields in tropical regions will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1–2 °C) expected to occur during the first half of the century. [21] During the second half of the century, further warming is projected to decrease crop yields in all regions including Canada and the Northern United States . [31] Many staple crops are extremely sensitive to heat and when temperatures rise over 36 °C (97 °F), soybean seedlings are killed and corn pollen loses its vitality. [32] [33] Higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in some regions can currently be disruptive, as they can cause phenological mismatch between flowering time of plants and the activity of pollinators , threatening their reproductive success. [34] In the longer term, however, they would result in longer growing seasons . [35] [36] For example, a 2014 study found that maize yields in the Heilongjiang region of China increased by between 7 and 17% per decade as a result of rising temperatures. [37] On the other hand, a year 2017 meta-analysis comparing data from four different methods of estimating effect of warming (two types of climate model, statistical regressions and field experiments where land around certain crops was warmed by a certain amount to compare them with the controls) concluded that on a global scale, warming alone has consistently negative effects on the yields of four most important crops, suggesting that any increases would be down to precipitation changes and the CO2 fertilization effect .

        "text": "Both droughts and floods contribute to decreases in crop yields . On average, climate change increases the overall amount of water contained in the atmosphere by 7% per every 1 °C (1.8 °F), thus increasing precipitation . [44] [45] However, this increase in precipitation is not distributed evenly in space ( atmospheric circulation patterns already cause different areas to receive different amounts of rainfall) or time: heavy rainfall, with the potential to cause floods, becomes more frequent. This means that under the probable mid-range climate change scenario , [46] [47] SSP2-4.5, precipitation events globally will become larger by 11.5%, yet the time between them will increase by an average of 5.1%. Under the highest-emission scenario SSP5-8.5 , there will be an 18.5% increase in size of events and 9.6% increase in the duration between them. At the same time, water losses by plants through evotranspiration will increase almost everywhere due to higher temperatures. [43] While the CO 2 fertilisation effect also reduces such losses by plants, it depends on the area's climate which effect will dominate. As such, the 2020–2023 Horn of Africa drought has been primarily attributed to the great increase in evotranspiration exacerbating the effect of persistent low rainfall, which would have been more manageable in the cooler preindustrial climate. [3] In total, this means that droughts have been occurring more frequently on average because of climate change. Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, South and Southeast Asia are the parts of the globe where droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense in spite of the global increase in precipitation. [48] Droughts disturb terrestrial precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture , [49] [50] and these effects can be aggravated by population growth and urban expansion spurring on increased demand for water. [51] The ultimate outcome is water scarcity , which results in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock, [52] exacerbating pre-existing poverty in developing countries and leading to malnutrition and potentially famine . [53] [32] Irrigation of crops is able to reduce or even remove the effects on yields of lower rainfall and higher temperatures – through localised cooling.  However, using water resources for irrigation has downsides and is expensive. [30] Further, some sources of irrigation water may become less reliable. This includes irrigation driven by water runoff from glaciers during the summer, as there has already been an observed retreat of glaciers since 1850 , and it is expected to continue, depleting the glacial ice and reducing or outright eliminating runoff. [55] In Asia, global warming of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) will reduce the ice mass of Asia's high mountains by about 29–43%,: [56] Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers: [57] In India alone, the river Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people. [58] [59] In the Indus River watershed, these mountain water resources contribute to up to 60% of irrigation outside of the monsoon season, and an additional 11% of total crop production. [9] Since Effects of climate change on the water cycle are projected to substantially increase precipitation in all but the westernmost parts of the watershed, the loss of the glaciers is expected to be offset: however, agriculture in the region will become more reliable on monsoon than ever, and hydropower generation would become less predictable and reliable.

        "text": "Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide may reduce the nutritional quality of some crops, with for instance wheat having less protein and less of some minerals. [88] : 439 [89] The nutritional quality of C3 plants (e.g. wheat, oats, rice) is especially at risk: lower levels of protein as well as minerals (for example zinc and iron) are expected. [5] : 1379 Food crops could see a reduction of protein , iron and zinc content in common food crops of 3 to 17%. [90] This is the projected result of food grown under the expected atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels of 2050. Using data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization as well as other public sources, the authors analyzed 225 different staple foods, such as wheat , rice , maize , vegetables , roots and fruits . [91] The effect of increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide on the nutritional quality of plants is not limited only to the above-mentioned crop categories and nutrients. A 2014 meta-analysis has shown that crops and wild plants exposed to elevated carbon dioxide levels at various latitudes have lower density of several minerals such as magnesium, iron, zinc, and potassium. [86] Studies using Free-Air Concentration Enrichment have also shown that increases in CO 2 lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop and non-crop plants with negative consequences for human nutrition, [92] [86] including decreased B vitamins in rice. [93] [94] This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein. [95] Empirical evidence shows that increasing levels of CO 2 result in lower concentrations of many minerals in plant tissues. Doubling CO 2 levels results in an 8% decline, on average, in the concentration of minerals. [86] Declines in magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron, zinc and other minerals in crops can worsen the quality of human nutrition. Researchers report that the CO 2 levels expected in the second half of the 21st century will likely reduce the levels of zinc, iron, and protein in wheat, rice, peas, and soybeans. Some two billion people live in countries where citizens receive more than 60 percent of their zinc or iron from these types of crops. Deficiencies of these nutrients already cause an estimated loss of 63 million life-years annually. [96] [97] Alongside a decrease in minerals, evidence shows that plants contain 6% more carbon, 15% less nitrogen, 9% less phosphorus, and 9% less sulfur at double CO 2 conditions. The increase in carbon is mostly attributed to carbohydrates without a structural role in plants – the human-digestable, calorie-providing starch and simple sugars. The decrease in nitrogen translates directly into a decrease in the protein content. As a result, higher CO 2 not only reduce a plant's micronutrients, but also the quality of its macronutrient combination. [86]",

[111] Around 9% of agricultural production is dependent in some way on insect pollination , [112] and some pollinator species are also adversely affected, with wild bumblebees known to be particularly vulnerable to recent warming. [113] [114] At the same time, insects are the most diverse animal taxa, and some species will benefit from the changes, including notable agricultural pests and disease vectors . [109] Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per year could gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom. Temperate places and higher latitudes are more likely to experience a dramatic change in insect populations: [115] for instance, the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic in British Columbia , Canada had killed millions of pine trees, partially because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae. [32] Likewise, potato tuber moth and Colorado potato beetle are predicted to spread into areas currently too cold for them. [116] Further, effects of climate change on the water cycle often mean that both wet seasons and drought seasons will become more intense. Some insect species will breed more rapidly because they are better able to take advantage of such changes in conditions. [117] This includes certain insect pests, such as aphids and whiteflies : [32] similarly, locust swarms could also cause more damage as the result. A notable example was the 2019–2022 locust infestation focused on East Africa , considered the worst of its kind in many decades. [118] [119] The fall armyworm , Spodoptera frugiperda , is a highly invasive plant pest, which can cause have massive damage to crops, especially maize. In the recent years, it has spread to countries in sub-Saharan Africa , and this spread is linked to climate change. It is expected that these highly invasive crop pests will spread to other parts of the planet since they have a high capacity to adapt to different environments. [4]",

        "text": "According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report from 2022, there is high confidence that in and of itself, climate change to date has left primarily negative effects on both crop yields and quality of produce, although there has been some regional variation: [5] : 724 more negative effects have been observed for some crops in low-latitudes (maize and wheat), while positive effects of climate change have been observed in some crops in high-latitudes (maize, wheat, and sugar beets ). [129] : 8 I.e. during the period 1981 to 2008, global warming has had negative effects on wheat yield in especially tropical regions, with decreases in average global yields by 5.5%. [130] A study in 2019 tracked ~20,000 political units globally for 10 crops ( maize , rice , wheat , soybean , barley , cassava , oil palm , rapeseed , sorghum and sugarcane ), providing more detail on the spatial resolution and a larger number of crops than previously studied. [128] It found that crop yields across Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia had in general decreased because of climate change (compared to the baseline value of 2004–2008 average data), though exceptions are present. The effect of global climate change on yields of different crops from climate trends ranged from −13.4% (oil palm) to 3.5% (soybean). The study also showed that effects are generally positive in Latin America. Effects in Asia and Northern and Central America are mixed. [128] While the Green Revolution had ensured the growth of overall crop production per land area of 250% to 300% since the 1960, [5] : 727 with around 44% attributed to newer crop varieties alone, [131] it is believed this growth would have been even greater without the counteracting role of climate change on major crop yields over the same period. Between 1961 and 2021, global agricultural productivity could have been 21% greater than it actually was, if it did not have to contend with climate change. Such shortfalls would have affected food security of vulnerable populations the most: [5] : 724 a study in 2019 showed that climate change has already increased the risk of food insecurity in many food insecure countries. [128] Even in developed countries such as Australia , extreme weather associated with climate change has been found to cause a wide range of cascading spillovers through supply chain disruption, in addition to its primary effect on fruit, vegetable, and livestock sectors and the rural communities reliant on them. [132] Between 1961 and 1985, cereal production more than doubled in developing nations , largely due to the development of irrigation, fertiliser, and seed varieties. [133] Even in the absence of further scientific/technological developments, many of the existing advancements have not been evenly distributed, and their spread from the developed world to the developing world is expected to drive some improvements on its own. Further, agricultural expansion has slowed down in the recent years, but this trend is widely expected to reverse in the future in order to maintain the global food supply under all but the most optimistic climate change scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement .

Most climate change assessments focus on \"four major crops\" – maize (corn), rice , wheat and soybeans – which are consumed directly and indirectly, as animal feed (the main purpose of soybeans). The three cereals are collectively responsible for half of the total human calorie intake, [138] and together with soybeans, they account for two thirds. [10] Different methods have been used to project future yields of these crops, and by 2019, the consensus was that warming would lead to aggregate declines of the four. Maize and soybean would decrease with any warming, whereas rice and wheat production might peak at 3 °C (5.4 °F) of warming. [88] : 453 In 2021, a paper which used an ensemble of 21 climate models estimated that under the most intense climate change scenario used at the time, RCP8.5 , global yields of these four crops would decline by between 3–12% around 2050 and by 11–25% by the year 2100. The losses were concentrated in what are currently the major agricultural producers and exporters. For instance, even by 2050, some agricultural areas of Australia , Brazil , South Africa , Southeast China , Southern Europe and the United States would suffer production losses of mostly maize and soybeans exceeding 25%. [139] A similar finding - that some major \"breadbaskets\" would begin to see unequivocal effects of climate change, both positive and negative, before the year 2040 - had been established in another study from the same year. [140] Since it represents the worst-case scenario of continually increasing emissions with no efforts to reduce them, RCP8.5 is often considered unrealistic, [141] and a less intense RCP4.5 scenario (which still leads to nearly 3 °C (5.4 °F) by century's end, far in excess of the Paris Agreement goals) is now usually considered a better match for the current trajectory.

[8] When the results from modelling experiments comparing the combined output of latest earth system models and dedicated agricultural crop models were published in 2021, the most notable new finding was the substantial reduction in projected global yields of maize. While the previous generation suggested that under the low-warming scenario, maize productivity would increase by around 5% by the end of the century, the latest had shown a reduction of 6% under the equivalent scenario, SSP1-2.6 . Under the high-emission SSP5-8.5, there was a global decline of 24% by 2100, as opposed to the earlier suggestion of a 1% increase. [140]",

        "text": "Climate change effects on rainfed wheat will vary depending on the region and local climatic conditions. Studies in Iran surrounding changes in temperature and rainfall are representative for several different parts of the world since there exists a wide range of climatic conditions. They range from temperate to hot-arid to cold semi-arid. Scenarios based on increasing temperature by up to 2.5 °C (4.5 °F) and rainfall decreases by up to 25% show wheat grain yield losses can be significant. The losses can be as much as 45% in temperate areas and over 50% in hot-arid areas. But in cold semi-arid areas yields can be increased somewhat (about 15%). Adaptation strategies with the most promise center around dates for seed planting. Late planting in November to January can have significant positive effects on yields due to the seasonality of rainfall. [147] However, those experiments did not consider the effects of CO 2 increases. Globally, temperature changes alone are expected to reduce annual wheat yield by 6% for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) of global warming. [10] However, other factors such as precipitation and the CO 2 fertilisation effect benefit wheat yields far more. In November 2021, the results from modelling experiments comparing the combined output of latest earth system models and dedicated agricultural crop models were published. While it projected a consistent decrease in future global yields of maize, particularly under greater warming, it found the opposite for wheat yields. When the previous generation of models suggested a 9% increase in global wheat yields by 2100 under the high-emission scenario, the updated results indicate that under its highest-warming SSP5-8.5 scenario, they would increase by 18%.

        "text": "Scientific understanding of how climate change would affect global food security has evolved over time. The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 suggested that by 2050, the number of people at risk of hunger will increase under all scenarios by between 8 and 80 million people, with nearly all of them in Sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia and Central America . However, this comparison was done relative to a world where no climate change had occurred, and so it does not rule out the possibility of an overall reduction in hunger risk when compared to present-day conditions. [5] : 717 The earlier Special Report on Climate Change and Land suggested that under a relatively high emission scenario (RCP6.0), cereals may become 1–29% more expensive in 2050 depending on the socioeconomic pathway. [88] : 439 Compared to a scenario where climate change is absent, this would put between 1–181 million people with low income at risk of hunger. [88] It is difficult to project the effect of climate change on utilization (protecting food against spoilage, being healthy enough to absorb nutrients, etc.) In 2016, a modelling study suggested that by mid-century, the most intense climate change scenario would reduce per capita global food availability by 3.2%, with a 0.7% decrease in red meat consumption and a 4% decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption. According to its numbers, 529,000 people would die between 2010 and 2050 as the result, primarily in South Asia and East Asia : two-thirds of those deaths would be caused by the lack of micronutrients from reduced fruit and vegetable supply, rather than outright starvation. Acting to slow climate change would reduce these projections by up to 71%. [172] Food prices are also expected to become more volatile. [173] As of 2017, around 821 million people had suffered from hunger. This was equivalent to about 11% of the world population: regionally, this included 23.2% of sub-Saharan Africa , 16.5% of the Caribbean and 14.8% of South Asia . [13] In 2021, 720 million to 811 million people were considered undernourished in 2021 (of whom 200,000, 32.3 million and 112.3 million people were at a \"catastrophic\", \"emergency\" and \"crisis\" levels of food insecurity, respectively). [12] In 2020, research suggested that the baseline projected level of socioeconomic development ( Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 ) would reduce this number to 122 million globally by 2050, even as the population grows to reach 9.2 billion. The effect of climate change would at most increase this 2050 figure by around 80 million, and the negative effect could be reduced to 20 million through enabling easier food trade with measures such as eliminating tariffs . [13] In 2021, a meta-analysis of 57 studies on food security was more pessimistic, suggesting that the year 2050 population at risk of hunger would be around 500 million under SSP2. Some variations of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with high climate change and a lack of equitable global development instead resulted in an outright increase of global hunger by up to 30% from its 2010 levels. [11] For the earlier IPCC Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, the analysis of four main SRES pathways had shown with medium confidence (about 50% certainty) [174] ) that trends of social and economic development in three of them (A1, B1, B2) would see the number of undernourished people decline to 100–130 million people by the year 2080, while trends in A2 projected 770 million undernourished – similar to the contemporary (early 21st century) figures of ~700 million people. Once the effect of climate change implied by those scenarios was taken into account, A1, B1 and B2 scenarios would see 100–380 million undernourished by 2080 (still a major decline in hunger from 2006 levels), and A2 would see 740–1,300 million, although there was only low (20% certainty) to medium certainty in these figures. [175] Sub-Saharan Africa would likely overtake Asia as the world's most food-insecure region, primarily due to differing socioeconomic trends. [176]",

        "text": "Some scientists consider the aforementioned projections of crop yields and food security of limited use, because in their view, they primarily model climate change as a change in mean climate state, and are not as well-equipped to consider climatic extremes. For instance, a paper published in 2021 had also attempted to calculate the number of people facing hunger in 2050 – but now on the assumption that a climate event with a 1% (i.e. once in 100 years) likelihood of occurring in the new climate (meaning it would have been effectively impossible in the present climate) were to impact that year. It estimated that such an event would increase the baseline number by 11–33% even in the low-emission scenario, and by 20–36% in the high-emission one. If such an event were to affect more vulnerable regions like South Asia , then they would have required triple their 2021 level of known food reserves to absorb the blow. [14] Notably, other papers show that simulating recent historical extreme events in climate models, such as the 2003 European heatwave , typically results in lower effects than what had been observed in the real world, indicating that the effects of future extreme events are also likely to be underestimated. [15] [177] The difference between climatic mean and extremes may be particularly important for determining areas where agriculture may stop being viable. In 2021, a research team aimed to extend climate model projections of mean changes in temperature and the water cycle to the year 2500. They suggested that under the second-strongest warming scenario RCP6.0, land area capable of supporting four major temperate crops (maize, potato, soybean and wheat) would become about 11% smaller by 2100 and 18.3% smaller by 2500, while for major tropical crops ( cassava , rice, sweet potato , sorghum , taro , and yam ), it would decline by only 2.3% around 2100, yet by around 15% by 2500. Under the low-emission scenario RCP2.6, changes are much smaller, with around 3% decline in suitable land area for temperate crops by 2500 and an equivalent gain for tropical trops by then. [178] Yet, another paper from 2021 suggested that by 2100, under the high-emission SSP5-8.5, 31% and 34% of the current crop and livestock production would leave what the authors have defined as a \"safe climatic space\": that is, those areas (most of South Asia and the Middle East , as well as parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Central America ) would experience very rapid shift in Holdridge life zones (HLZ) and associated weather, while also being low in social resilience. Notably, a similar fraction of global crop and livestock production would also experience a large change in HLZ, but in more developed areas which would have better chances of adapting. In contrast, under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6, 5% and 8% of crop and livestock production would leave what is defined as the safe climatic space. [16] Also in 2021, it was suggested that the high-emission scenario would result in a 4.5-fold increase in the probability of breadbasket failures (defined as a yield loss of 10% or more) by 2030, which could then increase 25 times by 2050. [180] This corresponds to reaching 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and 2 °C (3.6 °F) thresholds under that scenario: earlier research suggested that for maize, this would increase risks for multiple simultaneous breadbasket failures (yield loss of 10% or more) from 6% under the late-20th century climate to 40% and 54%, respectively. [6] Some countries are particularly dependent on imports from certain exporters, meaning that a crop failure in those countries would hit them disproportionately. I.e. a ban on export of staple crops from Russia , Thailand and the United States alone would place around 200 million people (90% from Sub-Saharan Africa) at risk of starvation. [179] Additionally, there is the issue of representing synchronisation - where extreme climate events happen to strike multiple important producer regions around the same time. It was estimated that if hypothetically, every region with a synchronized growing season were to experience crop failure at the same time, it would cause losses of four major crops between 17% and 34%. [181] More realistically, analysis of historic data suggested that there have already been synchronized climate events associated with up to 20% yield losses. [182] According to a 2016 estimate, if global maize, rice and wheat exports declined by 10%, 55 million people in 58 poor countries lose at least 5% of their food supply. [179] Further, two specific Rossby wave pattern are known to induce simultaneous heat extremes in either Eastern Asia , Eastern Europe and Central North America, or in Western Asia , Western Europe and Western Central North America, respectively. These heat extremes have already been shown to cause 3–4% declines in crop yield across the affected regions: [183] yet, concerningly, climate models overestimate the effects of such historic events in North America and underestimate them elsewhere, simulating effectively no net yield loss.

[36] [185] With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm: i.e. some farmers may choose to permanently leave drought-affected areas. [186] Agriculture employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts. [53] Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices ; a cost that is directly passed on to the consumer and affects the affordability of food. Some farms do not sell their produce but instead feed a family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world. [187] The agriculture industry in India makes up 52% of their employment and the Canadian Prairies supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the economy . [35] Notably, one estimate suggests that a warming of 3 °C (5.4 °F) relative to late 20th century (i.e. closer to 4 °C (7.2 °F) when compared to preindustrial temperatures – a level associated with the SSP5-8.5 scenario) would cause labour capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to decline by 30 to 50%, as the number of days when outdoor workers experience heat stress increases: up to 250 days the worst-affected parts of these two continents and of Central and South America . This could then increase crop prices by around 5%. [5] : 717 : 725 Similarly, North China Plain is also expected to be highly affected, in part due to the region's extensive irrigation networks resulting in unusually moist air. In scenarios without aggressive action to stop climate change , some heatwaves could become extreme enough to cause mass mortality in outdoor labourers, although they will remain relatively uncommon (up to around once per decade starting from 2l00 under the most extreme scenario). [184] Further, the role of climate change in undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies can be calculated as the loss of \"years of full health\". [5] : 717 One estimate presented in 2016 suggests that under the scenario of strong warming and low adaptation due to high global conflict and rivalry, such losses may take up 0.4% of the global GDP and 4% of the GDP in India and the South Asian region by the year 2100.

For instance, a 2013 paper estimated that if the high warming of RCP 8.5 scenario was not alleviated by CO 2 fertilisation effect, it would reduce aggregate yields by 17% by the year 2050: yet, it anticipated that this would be mostly offset through an 11% increase in cropland area.

[212] Direct effects of climate change include increased heat and water stress, altered crop phenology , and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river flow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favour of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects. [213] In Canada , notable increases are predicted for spring-sown wheat. [214]",

        "text": "Climate change adaptation measures may reduce the risk of negative effects on agriculture from climate change. Adaptation can take place through changes in management practices, agricultural innovation, institutional changes, and climate-smart agriculture . [215] To create a sustainable food system , these measures are considered as essential as changes needed to reduce global warming in general. [216] [217] Agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate fertilization use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies. [187] [218] On a government and global level, research and investments into agricultural productivity and infrastructure must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them. Government policies and programs must provide environmentally sensitive government subsidies , educational campaigns and economic incentives as well as funds, insurance and safety nets for vulnerable populations. [219] [187] [121] In addition, providing early warning systems , and accurate weather forecasts to poor or remote areas will allow for better preparation. [187]",
