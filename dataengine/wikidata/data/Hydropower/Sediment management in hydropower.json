[21] NHPC was incorporated by the Government of India in 1975, with an authorised capital of Rs. 200 crore. The Salal project was its first project. [22] The Stage-I of the powerhouse was commissioned in 1987; Stage-II between 1993 and 1995. The final commissioning of the project took place in 1996. [21] After completion, the Salal project was transferred to NHPC on an ownership basis. [22] The Government of Jammu and Kashmir is said to have had a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of India to receive the project at a depreciated cost. [23] However, according to the National Conference party, the coalition government in power at 1985, run by the Ghulam Mohammad Shah -wing of the National Conference and the Indian National Congress , surrendered the state's rights over the project. [24] The state of Jammu and Kashmir receives 12.5 percent of the energy generated from the project. [25] The rest is transmitted to the Northern Grid where it is distributed to the states of Punjab , Haryana , Delhi , Himachal Pradesh , Rajasthan , and Uttar Pradesh . Jammu and Kashmir also purchases additional power at regular prices. [24] [26]",

        "section": "Siltation",
        "text": "Sediment is a serious problem among Himalayan rivers (since the Himalayas are young mountains). [27] The Chenab river, especially, carries more silt than the others even among the 'Western Rivers'. Its annual silt load is estimated to be 32,000,000 m 3 (26,000 acre⋅ft). [28] From the very first year of operation, the reservoir of the Salal dam started silting up. Two severe floods in 1988 and 1992 further accelerated the siltation. [29] Within five years, the reservoir got silted up almost entirely. [30] As a result, the reservoir capacity got reduced from the intended 231,000 acre⋅ft (285,000,000 m 3 ) to 7,000 acre⋅ft (9,000,000 m 3 ). [29] As per the 1978 Salal agreement, the reservoir had to be maintained at Constant Full Reservoir Level at 487.68 m above sea level . Six under-sluices that were provided during the construction had to be plugged at the beginning of operation. Consequently, the 9.14 m (30 ft) high spillway gates form the only live storage of the reservoir. The rest is dead storage, which ended up acting as a siltation tank. [31] To alleviate the problem, the spillway gates are being opened at least once a month during the monsoon season as a desilting mechanism, with a discharge of about 4,250 cumecs. This is reported to have recovered some of the reservoir capacity, increasing it to 10,000 acre⋅ft (12,000,000 m 3 ). [32] As the spillway and the power intake are continuously passing sand, they cause  abrasion damage to the spillway concrete structure and the turbine equipment. [33] Studies report erosion in the civil structures such as the concrete sill of the spillway, the glacis and the bucket; [34] damage to the turbine components such as cracks in the turbine blades, knife edging of the outer edges and washing out of other components; [35] damage to the cooling system such as tubes being choked with stator faults encountered. [35] NHPC has been using various technical remedies to address these problems. [36] The silt accumulation has essentially converted the reservoir into an elevated river bed. [28] The situation is reported to be alarming and the future of the project uncertain. [5] \"During winters when water level goes abysmally down, it does not generate much [power],\" according to a state official. [4] In 2014–2015, the two powerhouses reported producing 3491 million KWH, [37] representing 57% capacity factor . [note 1]",

[3] The under-sluices would have enabled the 'drawdown flushing' of sediments. [note 4] However, at Pakistan's insistence, the under-sluices were permanently plugged with concrete, and the gates were reduced from 40 ft to 30 ft. This meant that the only live storage is between elevations 1,570–1,600 ft, and the storage below that level has gotten silted up, forming an elevated river bed. The level of the bed now varies between 477 m (1,565 ft) and 484 m (1,588 ft). [39]",

        "text": "Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for water diversion , agriculture , factory watermills , and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block anadromous fish runs, such as Atlantic salmon and American shad , and prevent important sediments from reaching estuaries . Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural water diversion in the arid country, with hydroelectric power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the Columbia Basin Project , which diverts water at the Grand Coulee Dam . The Bureau of Reclamation manages many of these water diversion projects. Some dams in the Pacific Northwest and California block passage for anadromous fish species such as Pacific Salmon and steelhead . Fish ladders and other passage facilities have been ineffective in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. [8] Bonneville Power Administration manages electricity on 11 dams on the Columbia River and 4 on the Snake River , which were built by the Army Corps of Engineers . In the Desert Southwest , dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the Glen Canyon Dam , the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the Grand Canyon , which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including humpback chub and razorback sucker . Some dam projects, such as those on the Salt River Project in Arizona , eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the Arizona Canal system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or arroyo heads out across the desert. So much water is taken out of the Colorado River for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the Gulf of California .",

        "section": "Methods of removal",
        "text": "There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed. [9] Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below. Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure. Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, PCBs in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream. [3]",

        "text": "While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them. [3] These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing environmental flow . Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, fish ladders can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There's debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location. Reservoir sedimentation can also be countered using specific dam management strategies.",

Parties to the agreement included the state of California , the state of Oregon , three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals. [10] This agreement called for the removal of four of the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project dams: the 1958 John C. Boyle Dam , the 1922 Copco Number 1 and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 Iron Gate Dam .  All four are privately owned by PacifiCorp .  At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria Microcystis aeruginosa in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs. On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending congressional approval. [11] Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . [12] The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities.  They include:  the 1975 100 ft (30 m) Lower Granite Dam , the 1970 98 ft (30 m) Little Goose Dam , the 1969 100 ft (30 m) Lower Monumental Dam , and the 1962 100 ft (30 m) Ice Harbor Dam . Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually. [15] The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.  As of 2011, two feet remained.  As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised.  The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers. [16] The Corps began dredging behind Lower Granite Dam in 2015. [17]",

The Kinni is a cold water fishery supporting a population of native Brook Trout and naturally reproducing Brown Trout. The Kinnickinnic River is officially designated as a Class I trout stream by the WI DNR, indicating it is a \"high quality\" trout water that has sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carrying capacity . [25] The Kinnickinnic is also designated as an Outstanding Resource Water (ORW) by the WI DNR both above State HWY 35, and below the Powell Falls Dam, however, the stretch of the Kinni through the City of River Falls is not included in this designation where the river is impounded into two reservoirs which do not support a fishery.  This ORW designation indicates the Kinni provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities. [26] This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.

        "text": "In the arch dam, stability is obtained by a combination of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. [42] The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected. Two types of single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam. The constant-radius type employs the same face radius at all elevations of the dam, which means that as the channel grows narrower towards the bottom of the dam the central angle subtended by the face of the dam becomes smaller. Jones Falls Dam , in Canada, is a constant radius dam. In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this subtended angle is kept constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels is taken care of by varying the radii. Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams. Parker Dam on the Colorado River is a constant-angle arch dam. A similar type is the double-curvature or thin-shell dam. Wildhorse Dam near Mountain City, Nevada , in the United States is an example of the type. This method of construction minimizes the amount of concrete necessary for construction but transmits large loads to the foundation and abutments. The appearance is similar to a single-arch dam but with a distinct vertical curvature to it as well lending it the vague appearance of a concave lens as viewed from downstream. The multiple-arch dam consists of a number of single-arch dams with concrete buttresses as the supporting abutments, as for example the Daniel-Johnson Dam , Québec, Canada. The multiple-arch dam does not require as many buttresses as the hollow gravity type but requires a good rock foundation because the buttress loads are heavy.",

        "text": "In a gravity dam, the force that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on the mass of the dam. [43] The water presses laterally (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam. [ citation needed ] The designer tries to shape the dam so if one were to consider the part of the dam above any particular height to be a whole dam itself, that dam also would be held in place by gravity, i.e., there is no tension in the upstream face of the dam holding the top of the dam down. The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled up than to make the material stick together against vertical tension. [ citation needed ] The shape that prevents tension in the upstream face also eliminates a balancing compression stress in the downstream face, providing additional economy. For this type of dam, it is essential to have an impervious foundation with high bearing strength. Permeable foundations have a greater likelihood of generating uplift pressures under the dam. Uplift pressures are hydrostatic pressures caused by the water pressure of the reservoir pushing up against the bottom of the dam. If large enough uplift pressures are generated there is a risk of destabilizing the concrete gravity dam. [44] [ citation needed ] On a suitable site, a gravity dam can prove to be a better alternative to other types of dams. When built on a solid foundation, the gravity dam probably represents the best-developed example of dam building. Since the fear of flood is a strong motivator in many regions, gravity dams are built in some instances where an arch dam would have been more economical. Gravity dams are classified as \"solid\" or \"hollow\" and are generally made of either concrete or masonry. The solid form is the more widely used of the two, though the hollow dam is frequently more economical to construct. Grand Coulee Dam is a solid gravity dam and Braddock Locks & Dam is a hollow gravity dam. [ citation needed ]",

        "text": "A tailings dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store tailings , which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore . Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, but due to cost, a tailings dam is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout the life of the particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with soil. [70] There are three raised tailings dam designs, the \"upstream\", \"downstream\", and \"centerline\", named according to the movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography , geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side. [71] [72] Because tailings dams often store toxic chemicals from the mining process, modern designs incorporate an impervious geomembrane liner to prevent seepage. [73] Water/slurry levels in the tailings pond must be managed for stability and environmental purposes as well. [72]",

Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were the \"crib\" and the \"plank\". Timber crib dams were erected of heavy timbers or dressed logs in the manner of a log house and the interior filled with earth or rubble. The heavy crib structure supported the dam's face and the weight of the water. Splash dams were timber crib dams used to help float logs downstream in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"Timber plank dams\" were more elegant structures that employed a variety of construction methods using heavy timbers to support a water retaining arrangement of planks.",

[74] Most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator ; to boost the power generation capabilities of a dam, the water may be run through a large pipe called a penstock before the turbine . A variant on this simple model uses pumped-storage hydroelectricity to produce electricity to match periods of high and low demand, by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. (For example, see Dinorwig Power Station .)",

Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A \"service spillway\" or \"primary spillway\" passes normal flow. An \"auxiliary spillway\" releases flow in excess of the capacity of the service spillway. An \"emergency spillway\" is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A \" fuse plug spillway\" is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away in the event of a large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing overflow in common floods. A spillway can be gradually eroded by water flow, including cavitation or turbulence of the water flowing over the spillway, leading to its failure. It was the inadequate design of the spillway and installation of fish screens that led to the 1889 over-topping of the South Fork Dam in Johnstown, Pennsylvania , resulting in the Johnstown Flood (the \"great flood of 1889\"). [75] Erosion rates are often monitored, and the risk is ordinarily minimized, by shaping the downstream face of the spillway into a curve that minimizes turbulent flow, such as an ogee curve.",

        "section": "Environmental impact",
        "text": "Reservoirs held behind dams affect many ecological aspects of a river. Rivers topography and dynamics depend on a wide range of flows, whilst rivers below dams often experience long periods of very stable flow conditions or sawtooth flow patterns caused by releases followed by no releases. Water releases from a reservoir including that exiting a turbine usually contain very little suspended sediment, and this, in turn, can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks; for example, the daily cyclic flow variation caused by the Glen Canyon Dam was a contributor to sand bar erosion . Older dams often lack a fish ladder , which keeps many fish from moving upstream to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths. [80] Even fish ladders do not prevent a reduction in fish reaching the spawning grounds upstream. [81] In some areas, young fish (\"smolt\") are transported downstream by barge during parts of the year. Turbine and power-plant designs that have a lower impact upon aquatic life are an active area of research. At the same time, however, some particular dams may contribute to the establishment of better conditions for some kinds of fish and other aquatic organisms. Studies have demonstrated the key role played by tributaries in the downstream direction from the main river impoundment, which influenced local environmental conditions and beta diversity patterns of each biological group. [82] Both replacement and richness differences contributed to high values of total beta diversity for fish (average = 0.77) and phytoplankton (average = 0.79), but their relative importance was more associated with the replacement component for both biological groups (average = 0.45 and 0.52, respectively). [82] A study conducted by de Almeida, R. A., Steiner, M.T.A and others found that, while some species declined in population by more than 30% after the building of the dam, others increased their population by 28%. [83] Such changes may be explained by the fact that the fish obtained \"different feeding habits, with almost all species being found in more than one group. [83] A large dam can cause the loss of entire ecospheres , including endangered and undiscovered species in the area, and the replacement of the original environment by a new inland lake.  As a result, the construction of dams have been opposed in various countries with some, such as Tasmania's Franklin Dam project, being cancelled following environmentalist campaigns. [84] Large reservoirs formed behind dams have been indicated in the contribution of seismic activity , due to changes in water load and/or the height of the water table. However, this is a mistaken assumption, because the relatively marginal stress attributed to the water load is orders of magnitude lesser than the force of an earthquake. The increased stress from the water load is insufficient to fracture the Earth's crust, and thus does not increase the severity of an earthquake. [85] Dams are also found to influence global warming . [86] The changing water levels in reservoirs are a source for greenhouse gases like methane . [87] While dams and the water behind them cover only a small portion of earth's surface, they harbour biological activity that can produce large quantities of greenhouse gases. [88]",

        "text": "Dam failures are generally catastrophic if the structure is breached or significantly damaged. Routine deformation monitoring and monitoring of seepage from drains in and around larger dams is useful to anticipate any problems and permit remedial action to be taken before structural failure occurs. Most dams incorporate mechanisms to permit the reservoir to be lowered or even drained in the event of such problems. Another solution can be rock grouting – pressure pumping Portland cement slurry into weak fractured rock. During an armed conflict, a dam is to be considered as an \"installation containing dangerous forces\" due to the massive impact of possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. As such, it is protected by the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL) and shall not be made the object of attack if that may cause severe losses among the civilian population. To facilitate the identification, a protective sign consisting of three bright orange circles placed on the same axis is defined by the rules of IHL. The main causes of dam failure include inadequate spillway capacity, piping through the embankment, foundation or abutments, spillway design error ( South Fork Dam ), geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying ( Vajont , Malpasset , Testalinden Creek dams), poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes ( Lawn Lake Dam , Val di Stava Dam collapse ), extreme rainfall ( Shakidor Dam ), earthquakes , and human, computer or design error ( Buffalo Creek Flood , Dale Dike Reservoir , Taum Sauk pumped storage plant ). A notable case of deliberate dam failure (prior to the above ruling) was the Royal Air Force 'Dambusters' raid on Germany in World War II (codenamed \" Operation Chastise \"), in which three German dams were selected to be breached in order to damage German infrastructure and manufacturing and power capabilities deriving from the Ruhr and Eder rivers. This raid later became the basis for several films. Since 2007, the Dutch IJkdijk foundation is developing, with an open innovation model and early warning system for levee/dike failures. As a part of the development effort, full-scale dikes are destroyed in the IJkdijk fieldlab. The destruction process is monitored by sensor networks from an international group of companies and scientific institutions.",

This holds true especially in tropical areas where mosquitoes (which are vectors for malaria ) and snails (which are vectors for Schistosomiasis ) can take advantage of this slow flowing water. [33] Resettlement Dams and the creation of reservoirs also require relocation of potentially large human populations if they are constructed close to residential areas. The record for the largest population relocated belongs to the Three Gorges dam built in China . Its reservoir submerged a large area of land, forcing over a million people to relocate. \"Dam related relocation affects society in three ways: an economic disaster, human trauma, and social catastrophe\", states Dr. Michael Cernea of the World Bank and Dr. Thayer Scudder, a professor at the California Institute of Technology . [2] As well, as resettlement of communities, care must also be taken not to irreparably damage sites of historical or cultural value. The Aswan Dam forced the movement of the Temple at Aswan to prevent its destruction by the flooding of the reservoir.",

        "text": "Water from Shihmen Dam is distributed to 28 districts in Taoyuan City , Hsinchu County and New Taipei , with a combined population of some 3.4 million people and more than 36,500 hectares (90,000 acres) of irrigated land. [11] [22] Each year, Shihmen furnishes 181.6 million m 3 (147,200 acre feet) of water for irrigation and industrial uses and about 127.4 million m 3 (103,300 acre feet) for residential use in downstream areas. In addition, an annual minimum river release of 299.6 million m 3 (242,900 acre feet) is maintained to provide a baseflow in the lower Dahan River. About 386.3 million m 3 (313,200 acre feet) of the aforementioned releases are utilized for hydroelectric generation. [23] The dam's power station generates roughly 200 million kilowatt hours annually and is integral in meeting peaking power demands in northern Taiwan's electricity grid. [11] Hydroelectric power releases peak in late July and August, largely because of air-conditioning usage in Taiwan's northern cities. [23] Shihmen is one of several key reservoirs in the Tamsui River system used to cut peak flood flows during typhoon events. Dam releases are coordinated with those from Feitsui Dam to the east in order to reduce the severity of flooding. [24] However, sediment accumulation in the reservoir has reduced its effectiveness on large flooding events. As a result, the \"frequency with which the Shih-men Dam discharges water down its spillway ranks first among Taiwan's reservoirs. The phrase 'the Shihmen Reservoir is releasing flood water' has become a euphemism for 'your fly is open'.\" [25] Additionally, large flooding events can cause turbidity levels in the reservoir to increase by over 3,000 times of average, forcing authorities to shut down water supplies. [26] This problem has been exacerbated by the increasing percentage of Shihmen water going to residential and industrial users, who generally demand clearer water than the agricultural users Shihmen was originally intended to supply. [27] The reduction in storage capacity has also affected Shihmen's ability to provide water during droughts. Demand often exceeds stored water in Shihmen Reservoir during the dry season, forcing frequent water-supply cuts. For several weeks in 1994, the drought-stricken Shihmen Dam service area was limited to one day of running water in three. [25] This has been further exacerbated by global climate change reducing the length of the rainy season in Taiwan, while increasing the intensity of rainfall when storms do strike the island. In 2015, Taiwan recorded its lowest winter rainfall since 1947, and the Shihmen reservoir fell to a record low of 24.5 percent of capacity, again forcing the government to enact water rationing. [28] Among the other benefits of the dam and reservoir is recreation. More than 160,000 tourists visit the dam each year, especially during floodwater releases. [14] The reservoir, its surrounding recreation area and towns are visited by a further 1.7 million people each year. [29] It is said that \"after its grand opening to the public in 1964, the Shihmen Reservoir has remained one of the top spots on Taiwan's sight-seeing billboards\". [30] Recreational and commercial fishing on the reservoir produces about 80,000 kilograms (180,000 lb) of fish each year, generating an annual revenue of NT$29.33 million. [30]",

        "text": "Poor land use and construction practices in the catchment area of Shihmen Dam have contributed to a severe sedimentation problem in the reservoir.  This sediment mainly comes from landslides and other erosion-related issues in the steep, rugged drainage basin , which have been exacerbated by deforestation, land-clearing for agriculture, and the opening of roads into mountainous areas. [25] The reservoir, which originally had a maximum depth of over 100 metres (330 ft), is estimated to be no more than 40 metres (130 ft) deep today. [25] The textbook The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow by Hubert Chanson describes the dam as having \"become a vast sediment trap with an inappropriate storage capacity to act as a flood control or water supply reservoir.\" [31] In 1981 it was estimated that 2.9 million tonnes of sediment flow into the reservoir each year, or a watershed erosion rate of 3,789 tonnes/km 2 . [12] According to a 2017 Taipei Times report, the amount of sediment flowing into the reservoir was 3.42 million tonnes per year. About 1.17 million tonnes were sluiced through the dam's outlets and another 900,000 tonnes were removed by excavation and dredging. The government has proposed to construct a sediment bypass tunnel,  which would prevent another 640,000 tonnes from entering the reservoir. [32] This technology has already been employed at reservoirs in Japan and Switzerland, and would essentially allow river water to be diverted around the reservoir instead of flowing into it during periods of high sediment runoff, such as after typhoons.

        "text": "A number of measures have been taken to try and reduce the amount of sediment flowing into Shihmen Reservoir. Because of the construction of hundreds of sediment-trapping dams or sabo dams, the upper reaches of the Dahan and its tributaries are now among the most heavily impounded river systems in Taiwan, with at least 123 such dams along the main stem alone. [25] The largest 24 sabo dams have collectively prevented some 36 million cubic metres (29,200 acre feet) of sediment from reaching Shihmen Reservoir. [34] Only one, the Junghua Dam , is still collecting sediment, although its 16 million cubic metre (13,000 acre foot) capacity is nearly full. [13] These sediment catching dams have also failed on several occasions causing even more debris and silt to wash into Shihmen. Among these was the failure of Baling Dam during Typhoon Wipha (2007) , which caused 10 million cubic metres (8,000 acre feet) of sediment to wash downstream, destroying the village of Baling. [35] Dredging efforts on Shihmen Reservoir have also been only partly successful. Beginning in 1985, seven dredging companies removed more than 10 million cubic metres (8,000 acre feet), but the reservoir continued filling with sediment faster than it could be excavated. The capacity of the silt disposal areas was exhausted in 1995. [25] Other measures taken to decrease sediment flow include the construction of retaining walls and the reforestation of clear-cut areas. In more recent years, the Taiwanese government has revived the idea of constructing more mega-dams in the Dahan River to increase water retention capacity and trap silt. The Gaotai Reservoir (高台水庫) near the indigenous community of Jianshi would consist of a dam 190 metres (620 ft) high with a 171 million cubic metre (139,000 acre-foot) storage capacity. This project could be built in conjunction with the Bilin Reservoir (比麟水庫) which would divert some water from the Dahan drainage to the Da'an River , increasing the water supply available for Hsinchu County . [36] The dam projects have been strongly criticized as an expensive, yet only marginally effective solution to the problem, and for their effects on local communities. [37]",

As a result, Shihmen is often considered to be among the worst in water quality among all Taiwan's reservoirs. [25] A large water-quality monitoring system is in place, installed circa 2005 at two points in Shihmen Reservoir. Called \"Vertical Profiling System\" or \"YSI 6600EDS\", the system measures a series of water quality factors by depth at intervals of 5 metres (16 ft). The turbidity , chlorophyll content, pH level, and dissolved oxygen levels in the reservoir are sent to the operator of the dam every three hours. A future plan for the system is to record algae growth, allowing action to be taken to prevent hypoxic events in the water. [38] In 2008, the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Agency allocated NT$200 million for eutrophication control projects at Shihmen, Feitsui, Zengwun and Kinmen Reservoirs. [39]",

The lake is significantly impacted by sedimentation and siltation issues, diminishing the overall water surface area, water storage capacity, and recreational opportunities. Sediment carried by the Missouri River and Niobrara River is slowed and trapped within the reservoir due to the dam impounding and thus stopping the natural river flow. Studies show approximately 5.1 million tons of sediment are deposited in the lake each year, which contributes to the lake's increasing size of delta area on the western portions of the lake. Approximately 60% of the sediment comes from the Nebraska Sandhills via the Niobrara River. As of 2016, approximately 30% of the lake's overall surface area has diminished due to sedimentation deposits, and some figures project by 2045 approximately 50% of the lake will be diminished due to sedimentation deposits. Presently, there is no plan or solution to remove or slow the progression of the siltation within the lake. [7]",
