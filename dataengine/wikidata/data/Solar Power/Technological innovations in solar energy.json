        "text": "A solar cell , or photovoltaic cell, is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect . The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. [12] The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery. [13] In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide , [14] although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. [15] These early solar cells cost US$286/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. [16] In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs . [17] [18] The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efficiency . [19] As of 2022 [update] over 90% of the market is crystalline silicon . [20] The array of a photovoltaic system , or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to alternating current (AC), through the use of inverters . [11] Multiple solar cells are connected inside panels. Panels are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase. [11] Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid when available, especially in developed countries with large markets. [21] In these grid-connected PV systems , use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight. In \"vertical agrivoltaics \" system, solar cells are oriented vertically on farmland, to allow the land to both grow crops and generate renewable energy. [22] Other configurations include floating solar farms , placing solar canopies over parking lots, and installing solar panels on roofs. [22]",

[31] A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough , the compact linear Fresnel reflector , the dish Stirling and the solar power tower . Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight and is then used for power generation or energy storage. [32] Thermal storage efficiently allows overnight electricity generation, [33] thus complementing PV. [34] CSP generates a very small share of solar power and in 2022 the IEA said that CSP should be better paid for its storage. [35] As of 2021 [update] the levelized cost of electricity from CSP is over twice that of PV. [36] However, their very high temperatures may prove useful to help decarbonize industries (perhaps via hydrogen) which need to be hotter than electricity can provide. [37]",

        "text": "Concentrated solar power plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44 TJ in its 68 m 3 storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%. [113] In stand alone PV systems , batteries are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid-connected photovoltaic power systems , excess electricity can be sent to the electrical grid . Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [114] When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be used later at night. Batteries used for grid-storage can stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads for a few hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation. Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include nickel-cadmium , lead-acid , nickel metal hydride , and lithium-ion . [115] [116] [ better source needed ] Lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Tesla Gigafactory 1 . In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95% of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be repurposed. [117] Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.

        "text": "Solar power is cleaner than electricity from fossil fuels , [20] so can be better for the environment. [128] Solar power does not lead to harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels creates some pollution. A 2021 study estimated the carbon footprint of manufacturing monocrystalline panels at 515 g CO 2 /kWp in the US and 740 g CO 2 /kWp in China, [129] but this is expected to fall as manufacturers use more clean electricity and recycled materials. [130] Solar power carries an upfront cost to the environment via production with a carbon payback time of several years as of 2022 [update] , [130] but offers clean energy for the remainder of their 30-year lifetime. [131] The life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar farms are less than 50 gram (g) per kilowatt-hour (kWh), [132] [133] [134] but with battery storage could be up to 150 g/kWh. [135] In contrast, a combined cycle gas-fired power plant without carbon capture and storage emits around 500 g/kWh, and a coal-fired power plant about 1000 g/kWh. [136] Similar to all energy sources where their total life cycle emissions are mostly from construction, the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. [134] Lifecycle surface power density of solar power varies [137] but averages about 7 W/m2, compared to about 240 for nuclear power and 480 for gas. [138] However, when the land required for gas extraction and processing is accounted for, gas power is estimated to have not much higher power density than solar. [20] PV requires much larger amounts of land surface to produce the same nominal amount of energy as sources [ which? ] with higher surface power density and capacity factor. According to a 2021 study, obtaining 25% to 80% of electricity from solar farms in their own territory by 2050 would require the panels to cover land ranging from 0.5% to 2.8% of the European Union , 0.3% to 1.4% in India , and 1.2% to 5.2% in Japan and South Korea . [139] Occupation of such large areas for PV farms could drive residential opposition as well as lead to deforestation, removal of vegetation and conversion of farm land. [140] However some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, use land for agriculture under PV , [141] [142] or floating solar, [143] together with other low-carbon power sources. [144] [145] Worldwide land use has minimal ecological impact. [146] Land use can be reduced to the level of gas power by installing on buildings and other built up areas. [137] Harmful materials are used in the production of solar panels, but generally in small amounts. [147] As of 2022 [update] , the environmental impact of perovskite is difficult to estimate, but there is some concern that lead may be a problem. [20] A 2021 International Energy Agency study projects the demand for copper will double by 2040. The study cautions that supply needs to increase rapidly to match demand from large-scale deployment of solar and required grid upgrades. [148] [149] More tellurium and indium may also be needed. [20] Recycling may help. [20] As solar panels are sometimes replaced with more efficient panels, the second-hand panels are sometimes reused in developing countries, for example in Africa . [150] Several countries have specific regulations for the recycling of solar panels . [151] [152] [153] Although maintenance cost is already low compared to other energy sources, [154] some academics have called for solar power systems to be designed to be more repairable . [155] [156] A very small proportion of solar power is concentrated solar power . Concentrated solar power may use much more water than gas-fired power. This can be a problem, as this type of solar power needs strong sunlight so is often built in deserts. [157]",

        "text": "The two most important forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, are intermittent energy sources : they are not available constantly, resulting in lower capacity factors . In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

[52] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions , geographic location and time of day. [53] There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal , which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity. [12] PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022. [54] It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, [55] compared to 25 GW of solar thermal. [54] Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building. Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments. China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013. Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19 , growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines. Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.

It is cheap, low-maintenance and scalable; adding to an existing PV installation as demanded arises is simple. Its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather. [12] PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station . [61] A household's solar panels can either be used for just that household or, if connected to an electrical grid, can be aggregated with millions of others. [62] The first utility-scale solar power plant was built in 1982 in Hesperia, California by ARCO . [63] The plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later. [64] However, over the following decades, PV cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper. [65] As a result, PV adoption has grown exponentially since 2010. [66] Global capacity increased from 230 GW at the end of 2015 to 890 GW in 2021. [67] PV grew fastest in China between 2016 and 2021, adding 560 GW, more than all advanced economies combined.

        "text": "Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC. Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps. Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy. [82] There are many forms of water energy: Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar. [86] In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,360 GW. [68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol. Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 [98] and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention . Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [205] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal . [206] For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\" [207]",

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

[6] Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest, 122 PW, is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet . [7] Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m 2 , or 3.5–7.0 kWh /m 2 per day. [8] Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection . When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle . The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones . [9] Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C. [10] By photosynthesis , green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived. [11] The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 122 PW·year = 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) per year. [12] In 2002 (2019), this was more energy in one hour (one hour and 25 minutes) than the world used in one year. [13] [14] Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass. [15] The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire. In 2021, Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was 450,000 km 2 — or about the same as the area of Sweden , or the area of Morocco , or the area of California (0.3% of the Earth's total land area). [20] Solar technologies are categorized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on the distance from the Equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all types of renewable energy, other than geothermal power and tidal power , are derived either directly or indirectly from the Sun. Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power , solar thermal collectors , pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful output. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing [ clarification needed ] the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternative resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies. [21] In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme , UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year. This took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. It was stated that solar energy has a global potential of 1,600 to 49,800 exajoules (4.4 × 10 14 to 1.4 × 10 16 kWh) per year (see table below) . [22]",

In 1897, Frank Shuman , a US inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys , [24] developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912. Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi , Egypt , between 1912 and 1913. His plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45–52 kilowatts (60–70 hp ) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres (4,800 imp gal; 5,800 US gal) of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision, and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy. [25] In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying:",

[31] [32] Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy.  Use of solar for heating can roughly be divided into passive solar concepts and active solar concepts, depending on whether active elements such as sun tracking and solar concentrator optics are used. Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement, and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When duly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment. [33] A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated, causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials [34] in a way that mimics greenhouses. Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. [35] Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. [36] In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain . [37]",

It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90–150 °C (194–302 °F). [40] Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of 315 °C (599 °F) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun. [41]",

[48] The plant, which had solar collection area of 4,700 m 2 (51,000 sq ft), could produce up to 22,700 L (5,000 imp gal; 6,000 US gal) per day and operate for 40 years. [48] Individual still designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications. [47] Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. [49] Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. [50] It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.

[73] Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese , who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth. [74] The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass . [73] When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment, they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates ' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design. [73] The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting , heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. [75] Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans, and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance. Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical \"cool communities\" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 °C at an estimated cost of US$1  billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530  million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.

Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. [77] [78] [79] While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age , French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. [80] Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. [46] [81] More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners , who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses. [82] Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius . [83] The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. [84] Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today. Plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers .",

The World Solar Challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race, where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres (1,877 mi) across central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide . In 1987, when it was founded, the winner's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour (42 mph) and by 2007 the winner's average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour (56.46 mph). [85] The North American Solar Challenge and the planned South African Solar Challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles. [86] [87] Some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power, such as for air conditioning, to keep the interior cool, thus reducing fuel consumption. [88] [89] In 1975, the first practical solar boat was constructed in England. [90] By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. [91] In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2006–2007. [92] There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010. [93] In 1974, the unmanned AstroFlight Sunrise airplane made the first solar flight. On 29 April 1979, the Solar Riser made the first flight in a solar-powered, fully controlled, man-carrying flying machine, reaching an altitude of 40 ft (12 m). In 1980, the Gossamer Penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics. This was quickly followed by the Solar Challenger which crossed the English Channel in July 1981. In 1990 Eric Scott Raymond in 21 hops flew from California to North Carolina using solar power. [94] Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the Pathfinder (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres (96,864 ft) in 2001. [95] The Zephyr , developed by BAE Systems , is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft, making a 54-hour flight in 2007, and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010. [96] From March 2015 to July 2016, Solar Impulse , an electric aircraft , successfully circumnavigated the globe. It is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power. The design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days. [97] A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands, causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon . Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high. [98]",

        "text": "Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical . [100] A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis . [101] The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol ) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. [102] Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 –  the splitting of seawater providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. [103] In addition, chemical energy storage is another solution to solar energy storage. [104] Hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F). [105] Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. [106] Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute of Science uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen. [107]",

        "section": "Energy storage methods",
        "text": "Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations . Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower peak demand , shift time-of-use to off-peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements. [108] [109] Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber's salt are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately 64 °C or 147 °F). The \"Dover House\" (in Dover, Massachusetts ) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948. [110] Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts . Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The Solar Two project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules (400,000 kWh) in its 68 m 3 storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%. [111] Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid , while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month. [112] Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator. [113]",

        "text": "Beginning with the surge in coal use, which accompanied the Industrial Revolution , energy consumption steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels . The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th  century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum . [114] The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world. It brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. [115] [116] Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US (SERI, now NREL ), Japan ( NEDO ), and Germany ( Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE ). [117] Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s. [118] These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. [119] As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s, but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s, and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. [120] Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154  GW as of 2007. [120] The International Energy Agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces: [1] In 2011, a report by the International Energy Agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water, and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change and transitioning to renewable energy . The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters. \"The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale\". [121] In 2021 Lazard estimated the levelized cost of new build unsubsidized utility scale solar electricity at less than 37 dollars per MWh and existing coal-fired power above that amount. [122] [123] The 2021 report also said that new solar was also cheaper than new gas-fired power, but not generally existing gas power. [123]",

Most modules use wafer -based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells . The structural ( load carrying ) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are usually connected electrically in series , one to another to the desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase current. The power (in watts ) of the module is the voltage (in volts ) multiplied by the current (in amperes ), and depends both on the amount of light and on the electrical load connected to the module. The manufacturing specifications on solar panels are obtained under standard conditions, which are usually not the true operating conditions the solar panels are exposed to on the installation site. [10] A PV junction box is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use MC4 connectors to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.

AC modules are defined by Underwriters Laboratories as the smallest and most complete system for harvesting solar energy.

Panels are typically connected in series of one or more panels to form strings to achieve a desired output voltage, and strings can be connected in parallel to provide the desired current capability (amperes) of the PV system. In string connections the voltages of the modules add, but the current is determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\". In parallel connections the voltages will be the same, but the currents add. Arrays are connected up to meet the voltage requirements of the inverters and to not greatly exceed the current limits. Blocking and bypass diodes may be incorporated within the module or used externally to deal with partial array shading, in order to maximize output. For series connections, bypass diodes are placed in parallel with modules to allow current to bypass shaded modules which would otherwise severely limit the current. For paralleled connections, a blocking diode may be placed in series with each module's string to prevent current flowing backwards through shaded strings thus short-circuiting other strings.",

        "text": "Each module is rated by its DC output power under standard test conditions (STC) and hence the on field output power might vary. Power typically ranges from 100 to 365 Watts (W). The efficiency of a module determines the area of a module given the same rated output –  an 8% efficient 230 W module will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 230 W module. Some commercially available solar modules exceed 24% efficiency. [35] [36] Currently, [ needs update ] the best achieved sunlight conversion rate (solar module efficiency) is around 21.5% in new commercial products [37] typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation. The most efficient mass-produced solar modules have power density values of up to 175 W/m 2 (16.22 W/ft 2 ). [38] The current versus voltage curve of a module provides useful information about its electrical performance. [39] Manufacturing processes often cause differences in the electrical parameters of different modules photovoltaic, even in cells of the same type. Therefore, only the experimental measurement of the I–V curve allows us to accurately establish the electrical parameters of a photovoltaic device. This measurement provides highly relevant information for the design, installation and maintenance of photovoltaic systems. Generally, the electrical parameters of photovoltaic modules are measured by indoor tests. However, outdoor testing has important advantages such as no expensive artificial light source required, no sample size limitation, and more homogeneous sample illumination. Capacity factor of solar panels is limited primarily by geographic latitude and varies significantly depending on cloud cover, dust, day length and other factors. In the United Kingdom , seasonal capacity factor ranges from 2% (December) to 20% (July), with average annual capacity factor of 10–11%, while in Spain the value reaches 18%. [40] Globally, capacity factor for utility-scale PV farms was 16.1% in 2019. [41] [ unreliable source? ] Overheating is the most important factor for the efficiency of the solar panel. [42]",

        "text": "Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): irradiance of 1,000 W/m 2 , solar spectrum of AM 1.5 and module temperature at 25 °C. [44] The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on geographic location, time of day, the day of the year, amount of solar irradiance , direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, soiling , state of charge, and temperature. Performance of a module or panel can be measured at different time intervals with a DC clamp meter or shunt and logged, graphed, or charted with a chart recorder or data logger. For optimum performance, a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular to direct sunlight. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels and optimize output. These bypass diodes are usually placed along groups of solar cells to create a continuous flow. [45] Electrical characteristics include nominal power (P MAX , measured in W ), open-circuit voltage (V OC ), short-circuit current (I SC , measured in amperes ), maximum power voltage (V MPP ), maximum power current (I MPP ), peak power, ( watt-peak , W p ), and module efficiency (%). Open-circuit voltage or V OC is the maximum voltage the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. [46] V OC can be measured with a voltmeter directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable. The peak power rating, W p , is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately 1 by 2 metres (3 ft × 7 ft), will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 600 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.

        "text": "Solar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by the accumulation of dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates on the solar panels, collectively referred to as soiling . \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures. [59] The average soiling loss in the world in 2018 is estimated to be at least 3% – 4%. [60] Paying to have solar panels cleaned is a good investment in many regions, as of 2019. [60] However, in some regions, cleaning is not cost-effective. In California as of 2013 soiling-induced financial losses were rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels in California lost a little less than 0.05% of their overall efficiency per day. [61] There are also occupational hazards with solar panel installation and maintenance. A 2015–2018 study in the UK investigated 80 PV-related incidents of fire, with over 20 \"serious fires\" directly caused by PV installation, including 37 domestic buildings and 6 solar farms. In 1 ⁄ 3 of the incidents a root cause was not established and in a majority of others was caused by poor installation, faulty product or design issues. The most frequent single element causing fires was the DC isolators. [62] A 2021 study by kWh Analytics determined median annual degradation of PV systems at 1.09% for residential and 0.8% for non-residential ones, almost twice that previously assumed. [63] A 2021 module reliability study found an increasing trend in solar module failure rates with 30% of manufacturers experiencing safety failures related to junction boxes (growth from 20%) and 26% bill-of-materials failures (growth from 20%). [64] Cleaning methods for solar panels can be divided into 5 groups: manual tools, mechanized tools (such as tractor mounted brushes), installed hydraulic systems (such as sprinklers), installed robotic systems, and deployable robots. Manual cleaning tools are by far the most prevalent method of cleaning, most likely because of the low purchase cost. However, in a Saudi Arabian study done in 2014, it was found that \"installed robotic systems, mechanized systems, and installed hydraulic systems are likely the three most promising technologies for use in cleaning solar panels\".

[89] With the rise of global awareness, institutions such as the IRS have adopted a tax credit format, refunding a portion of any solar panel array for private use. [90] The price of a solar array only continues to fall. Average pricing information divides in three pricing categories: those buying small quantities (modules of all sizes in the kilowatt range annually), mid-range buyers (typically up to 10 MWp annually), and large quantity buyers (self-explanatory—and with access to the lowest prices). Over the long term there is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and modules. For example, in 2012 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about US$0.60, which was 250 times lower than the cost in 1970 of US$150. [91] [92] A 2015 study shows price/kWh dropping by 10% per year since 1980, and predicts that solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030, whereas the International Energy Agency predicts 16% by 2050. [93] Real-world energy production costs depend a great deal on local weather conditions. In a cloudy country such as the United Kingdom, the cost per produced kWh is higher than in sunnier countries like Spain. Following to RMI , Balance-of-System (BoS) elements, this is, non-module cost of non- microinverter solar modules (as wiring, converters, racking systems and various components) make up about half of the total costs of installations. For merchant solar power stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price. This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'. [89]",

[13] Investments in renewable sources as well as the technologies for energy efficiency represent a determining factor in the investments made under the context of the Paris Agreement and the fight against climate change and air pollution. Among financing of the public sector, the government has been using financial incentives and regulations that are targeted at the private sector. This collectively move is the cause of the continued increase in the clean energy capacity. The investments in renewable electricity generation technologies in 2015 were over $308 billion USD and in 2019 this figure rose to $311 billion USD. [14] Startups with new technology based innovation are considered to be an attractive investment in a clean technology sector. Venture capital and crowdfunding platforms are crucial sources for developing ventures that lead to the introduction of new technologies. In the last decade, startups have significantly contributed to the increase in installed capacity for solar and wind power. The trendsetting firms that design new technologies and devise strategies for the industry to excel and to be more resilient in the face of threats. [15] [16] In 2008, clean technology venture investments in North America, Europe, China, and India totaled a record $8.4 billion. Cleantech Venture Capital firms include NTEC, Cleantech Ventures , and Foundation Capital . The preliminary 2008 total represents the seventh consecutive year of growth in venture investing, widely recognized as a leading indicator of overall investment patterns. [17] Investment in clean technology has grown significantly, with a considerable impact on production costs and productivity, especially, within energy intensive industries. The World Bank notes that these investments are enhancing economic efficiency, supporting sustainable development objectives, and promoting energy security by decreasing dependence on fossil fuel. [13] China is seen as a major growth market for cleantech investments currently, with a focus on renewable energy technologies. [18] In 2014, Israel , Finland and the US were leading the Global Cleantech Innovation Index , out of 40 countries assessed, while Russia and Greece were last. [19] Renewable energy investment has achieved substantial scale with annual investments around $300 billion. This volume of investment is fundamental to the global energy transition and remains in spite of an R&D funding plateau, representing the sector's healthy expansion and appreciation of renewable technology's promise. Several journals offer in-depth analyses and forecasts of this investment trend, stressing its significant role in attainment of the world energy and climate targets. [14] With regards to private investments, the investment group Element 8 has received the 2014 CleanTech Achievement award from the CleanTech Alliance, a trade association focused on clean tech in the State of Washington, for its contribution in Washington State's cleantech industry. [20] Strategic investments in clean technologies within supply chains are increasingly influenced by sustainable market forces. These investments are vital for manufacturers, enhancing not only the sustainability of production processes, but, also encouraging a comprehensive transition towards sustainability across the entire supply chain. Detailed case studies and industry analyses highlight the economic and environmental benefits of such strategic investments. [15] According to the published research, the top clean technology sectors in 2008 were solar, biofuels, transportation, and wind. Solar accounted for almost 40% of total clean technology investment dollars in 2008, followed by biofuels at 11%. In 2019, sovereign wealth funds directly invested just under US$3 billion in renewable energy . [21] The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , Denmark was expected to create a framework whereby limits would eventually be placed on greenhouse gas emissions. Many proponents of the cleantech industry hoped for an agreement to be established there to replace the Kyoto Protocol . As this treaty was expected, scholars had suggested a profound and inevitable shift from \" business as usual .\" [23] However, the participating States failed to provide a global framework for clean technologies. The outburst of the 2008 economic crisis then hampered private investments in clean technologies, which were back at their 2007 level only in 2014. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris is expected to achieve a universal agreement on climate, which would foster clean technologies development. [24] On 23 September 2019, the Secretary-General of the United Nations hosted a Climate Action Summit in New York. [25] In 2022 the investment in cleantech (also called climatetech) boomed. \"In fact, climate tech investment in the 12 months to Q3 2022 represented more than a quarter of every venture dollar invested, a greater proportion than 12 of the prior 16 quarters.\" [26] US leads in carbon capture technologies, with nearly 30% of patents. It also leads in plastic recycling and climate change adaptation technologies, but has a lower share in low-carbon energy (13%). [7] Japan excels in hydrogen-related (29.3%) and low-carbon energy technologies (26.2%). [7] [27] [28] Chinese applicants dominate the field of ICT-related clean technologies, accounting for more than 37% of patents between 2017 and 2021. Meanwhile, South Korean applicants make notable contributions in ICT with 12.6%, in hydrogen technologies with 13%, and in low-carbon energy with 15.5%. [29] About half of the EU's clean technologies are in the launch or early revenue stage, 22% are in the scale-up stage, and 10% are mature or consolidating. [7] [30] [31]",

The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft , but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid-connected systems for power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC . There is also a smaller market for stand alone systems for remote dwellings, boats , recreational vehicles , electric cars , roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing , and cathodic protection of pipelines . Photovoltaic power generation employs solar modules composed of a number of solar cells containing a semiconductor material. [17] Copper solar cables connect modules (module cable), arrays (array cable), and sub-fields. Because of the growing demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years. [18] [19] [20] Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly in solar modules. Photovoltaic module power is measured under standard test conditions (STC) in \"W p \" ( watts peak ). [21] The actual power output at a particular place may be less than or greater than this rated value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors.

        "text": "Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): irradiance of 1,000 W/m 2 , solar spectrum of AM 1.5 and module temperature at 25 °C. [34] The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on geographic location, time of day, the day of the year, amount of solar irradiance , direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, soiling , state of charge, and temperature. Performance of a module or panel can be measured at different time intervals with a DC clamp meter or shunt and logged, graphed, or charted with a chart recorder or data logger. For optimum performance, a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular to direct sunlight. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels and optimize output. These bypass diodes are usually placed along groups of solar cells to create a continuous flow. [35] Electrical characteristics include nominal power (P MAX , measured in W ), open-circuit voltage (V OC ), short-circuit current (I SC , measured in amperes ), maximum power voltage (V MPP ), maximum power current (I MPP ), peak power ( watt-peak , W p ), and module efficiency (%). Open-circuit voltage or V OC is the maximum voltage the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. [36] V OC can be measured with a voltmeter directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable. The peak power rating, W p , is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately 1 by 2 metres (3 ft × 7 ft), will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 600 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.

        "text": "In 1977 crystalline silicon solar cell prices were at $76.67/W. [83] Although wholesale module prices remained flat at around $3.50 to $4.00/W in the early 2000s due to high demand in Germany and Spain afforded by generous subsidies and shortage of polysilicon, demand crashed with the abrupt ending of Spanish subsidies after the market crash of 2008, and the price dropped rapidly to $2.00/W. Manufacturers were able to maintain a positive operating margin despite a 50% drop in income due to innovation and reductions in costs. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules suddenly dropped below the $1.00/W mark, taking many in the industry by surprise, and has caused a number of solar manufacturing companies to go bankrupt throughout the world. The $1.00/W cost is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV, but most experts do not believe this price point is sustainable. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, may mean that further price reductions are possible. [3] The average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the Solarbuzz group fell from $3.50/watt to $2.43/watt over the course of 2011. [84] In 2013 wholesale prices had fallen to $0.74/W. [83] This has been cited as evidence supporting ' Swanson's law ', an observation similar to the famous Moore's Law , which claims that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity. [83] The Fraunhofer Institute defines the 'learning rate' as the drop in prices as the cumulative production doubles, some 25% between 1980 and 2010. Although the prices for modules have dropped quickly, current inverter prices have dropped at a much lower rate, and in 2019 constitute over 61% of the cost per kWp, from a quarter in the early 2000s. [55] Note that the prices mentioned above are for bare modules, another way of looking at module prices is to include installation costs. In the US, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the price of installed rooftop PV modules for homeowners fell from $9.00/W in 2006 to $5.46/W in 2011. Including the prices paid by industrial installations, the national installed price drops to $3.45/W. This is markedly higher than elsewhere in the world, in Germany homeowner rooftop installations averaged at $2.24/W. The cost differences are thought to be primarily based on the higher regulatory burden and lack of a national solar policy in the US. [85] By the end of 2012 Chinese manufacturers had production costs of $0.50/W in the cheapest modules. [86] In some markets distributors of these modules can earn a considerable margin, buying at factory-gate price and selling at the highest price the market can support ('value-based pricing'). [3] In California PV reached grid parity in 2011, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). [87] Grid parity had been reached in 19 markets in 2014. [88] [89]",

        "text": "The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is the cost per kWh based on the costs distributed over the project lifetime, and is thought to be a better metric for calculating viability than price per wattage. LCOEs vary dramatically depending on the location. [3] The LCOE can be considered the minimum price customers will have to pay the utility company in order for it to break even on the investment in a new power station. [5] Grid parity is roughly achieved when the LCOE falls to a similar price as conventional local grid prices, although in actuality the calculations are not directly comparable. [90] Large industrial PV installations had reached grid parity in California in 2011. [80] [90] Grid parity for rooftop systems was still believed to be much farther away at this time. [90] Many LCOE calculations are not thought to be accurate, and a large amount of assumptions are required. [3] [90] Module prices may drop further, and the LCOE for solar may correspondingly drop in the future. [91] Because energy demands rise and fall over the course of the day, and solar power is limited by the fact that the sun sets, solar power companies must also factor in the additional costs of supplying a more stable alternative energy supplies to the grid in order to stabilize the system, or storing the energy somehow (current battery technology cannot store enough power). These costs are not factored into LCOE calculations, nor are special subsidies or premiums that may make buying solar power more attractive. [5] The unreliability and temporal variation in generation of solar and wind power is a major problem. Too much of these volatile power sources can cause instability of the entire grid. [92] As of 2017 power-purchase agreement prices for solar farms below $0.05/kWh are common in the United States, and the lowest bids in some Persian Gulf countries were about $0.03/kWh. [93] The goal of the United States Department of Energy is to achieve a levelised cost of energy for solar PV of $0.03/kWh for utility companies. [94]",

[100] Likewise, the application of solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly and the worldwide installed capacity reached one terawatt in April 2022. [101] The total power output of the world's PV capacity in a calendar year is now beyond 500 TWh of electricity. This represents 2% of worldwide electricity demand. More than 100 countries , such as Brazil and India , use solar PV. [102] [103] China is followed by the United States and Japan , while installations in Germany , once the world's largest producer, have been slowing down. Honduras generated the highest percentage of its energy from solar in 2019, 14.8%. [104] As of 2019, Vietnam has the highest installed capacity in Southeast Asia, about 4.5 GW. [105] The annualized installation rate of about 90 W per capita per annum places Vietnam among world leaders. [105] Generous Feed-in tariff (FIT) and government supporting policies such as tax exemptions were the key to enable Vietnam's solar PV boom. Underlying drivers include the government's desire to enhance energy self-sufficiency and the public's demand for local environmental quality. [105] A key barrier is limited transmission grid capacity. [105] China has the world's largest solar power capacity, with 390 GW of installed capacity in 2022 compared with about 200 GW in the European Union, according to International Energy Agency data. [106] Other countries with the world's largest solar power capacities include the United States, Japan and Germany.  In 2017, it was thought probable that by 2030 global PV installed capacities could be between 3,000 and 10,000 GW. [93] Greenpeace in 2010 claimed that 1,845 GW of PV systems worldwide could be generating approximately 2,646 TWh/year of electricity by 2030, and by 2050 over 20% of all electricity could be provided by PV.

        "text": "In 2019, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 47.1% was achieved by using multi-junction concentrator solar cells, developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado, US. [141] The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by Sharp Corporation at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009, [142] and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate band gap that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (η>30%) [143] are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (η>20%). Recent developments in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s. [144] To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges 6.7–8.94% for small molecule, 8.4–10.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7–21% for perovskite OPVs. [145] [146] OPVs are expected to play a major role in the PV market. Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable. Several companies have begun embedding power optimizers into PV modules called smart modules . These modules perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease. [147] One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from silica , and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the solar cells , but reflects infrared rays (which carry heat). [148]",

        "text": "For behind-the-meter rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes two-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid, allowing for net metering . However, electricity networks traditionally are not designed to deal with two-way energy transfer, which may introduce technical issues. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network. [162] There are solutions to manage the over-voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions. High generation during the middle of the day reduces the net generation demand, but higher peak net demand as the sun goes down can require rapid ramping of utility generating stations, producing a load profile called the duck curve . There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charges when electricity prices are reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example in residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economic decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematic evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.

[120] Polish philosopher Henryk Skolimowski framed it like so: \"science concerns itself with what is , technology with what is to be .\" [121] : 375 The direction of causality between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists, philosophers and policymakers. [122] Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge, most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge, but instead from engineering, tinkering and chance. [123] : 217–240 For example, in the 1940s and 1950s, when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude, jet engines were invented through \"running the device to destruction, analyzing what broke [...] and repeating the process\". [119] Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them. [123] : 217–240 Many discoveries also arose from pure chance, like the discovery of penicillin as a result of accidental lab contamination. [124] Since the 1960s, the assumption that government funding of basic research would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility. [125] [126] Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of serendipity and convexity through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes. [123] [127] Despite this, modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep, domain-specific scientific knowledge. In 1975, there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S.; by 1989, this increased to an average of one citation per patent. The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry, chemistry, and electronics. [128] A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents. [129]",

The reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. A working fluid (e.g. molten salt [43] ) is heated to 150–350 °C (302–662 °F) as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system. [44] Trough systems are the most developed CSP technology. The Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) plants in California, the world's first commercial parabolic trough plants, Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada , and Andasol , Europe's first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative, along with Plataforma Solar de Almería 's SSPS-DCS test facilities in Spain .

        "text": "A solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors ( heliostats ) that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower; the receiver contains a heat-transfer fluid, which can consist of water-steam or molten salt . Optically a solar power tower is the same as a circular Fresnel reflector. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500–1000 °C (773–1,273 K or 932–1,832 °F) and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system. [44] An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower. Power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems, but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability. Beam down tower application is also feasible with heliostats to heat the working fluid. [49] The Solar Two in Daggett , California and the CESA-1 in Plataforma Solar de Almeria Almeria, Spain, are the most representative demonstration plants. The Planta Solar 10 (PS10) in Sanlucar la Mayor , Spain, is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world. The 377 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility , located in the Mojave Desert , was the largest CSP facility in the world, and uses three power towers. [50] Ivanpah generated only 0.652 TWh (63%) of its energy from solar means, and the other 0.388 TWh (37%) was generated by burning natural gas . [51] [52] [53] Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used instead of steam as heat-transfer fluid for increased electricity production efficiency. However, because of the high temperatures in arid areas where solar power is usually located, it is impossible to cool down carbon dioxide below its critical temperature in the compressor inlet. Therefore, supercritical carbon dioxide blends with higher critical temperature are currently in development.",

The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250–700 °C (482–1,292 °F) and then used by a Stirling engine to generate power. [44] Parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency (between 31% and 32%), and their modular nature provides scalability. The Stirling Energy Systems (SES), United Sun Systems (USS) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) dishes at UNLV , and Australian National University 's Big Dish in Canberra , Australia are representative of this technology. A world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25% by SES dishes at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) in New Mexico on 31 January 2008, a cold, bright day. [58] According to its developer, Ripasso Energy, a Swedish firm, in 2015 its Dish Sterling system being tested in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa showed 34% efficiency. [59] The SES installation in Maricopa, Phoenix was the largest Stirling Dish power installation in the world until it was sold to United Sun Systems . Subsequently, larger parts of the installation have been moved to China as part of the huge energy demand.",

        "text": "Bulk power from CSP today is much more expensive than solar PV or Wind power, however when including energy storage CSP can be a cheaper alternative. As early as 2011, the rapid decline of the price of photovoltaic systems lead to projections that CSP will no longer be economically viable. [90] As of 2020, the least expensive utility-scale concentrated solar power stations in the United States and worldwide are five times more expensive than utility-scale photovoltaic power stations , with a projected minimum price of 7 cents per kilowatt-hour for the most advanced CSP stations against record lows of 1.32 cents per kWh [91] for utility-scale PV. [92] This five-fold price difference has been maintained since 2018. [93] Even though overall deployment of CSP remains limited in the early 2020s, the levelized cost of power from commercial scale plants has decreased significantly since the 2010s. With a learning rate estimated at around 20% cost reduction of every doubling in capacity [94] the cost were approaching the upper end of the fossil fuel cost range at the beginning of the 2020s driven by support schemes in several countries, including Spain, the US, Morocco, South Africa, China, and the UAE: CSP deployment has slowed down considerably as most of the above-mentioned markets have cancelled their support, [95] as the technology turned out to be more expensive on a per kWH basis than solar PV and wind power. CSP in combination with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is expected by some to remain cheaper than PV with lithium batteries for storage durations above 4 hours per day, [96] while NREL expects that by 2030 PV with 10-hour storage lithium batteries will cost the same as PV with 4-hour storage used to cost in 2020. [97] Combining the affordability of PV and the dispatchability of CSP is a promising avenue for high capacity factor solar power at low cost. Few PV-CSP plants in China are hoping to operate profitably on the regional coal tariff of US$50 per MWh in the year 2021. [98]",

        "text": "In 2008, Spain launched the first commercial scale CSP market in Europe. Until 2012, solar-thermal electricity generation was initially eligible for feed-in tariff payments (art. 2 RD 661/2007) – leading to the creation of the largest CSP fleet in the world which at 2.3 GW of installed capacity contributes about 5TWh of power to the Spanish grid every year. [99] The initial requirements for plants in the FiT were: The capacity limits for the different system types were re-defined during the review of the application conditions every quarter (art. 5 RD 1578/2008, Annex III RD 1578/2008). Prior to the end of an application period, the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade (art. 5 RD 1578/2008). [100] Because of cost concerns Spain has halted acceptance of new projects for the feed-in-tariff on 27 January 2012 [101] [102] Already accepted projects were affected by a 6% \"solar-tax\" on feed-in-tariffs, effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff. [103] In this context, the Spanish Government enacted the Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 [104] in 2013, aimed at the adoption of urgent measures to guarantee the economic and financial stability of the electric system, laying the foundations of the new Law 24/2013 of the Spanish electricity sector. [105] This new retroactive legal-economic framework applied to all the renewable energy systems was developed in 2014 by the RD 413/2014, [106] which abolished the former regulatory frameworks set by the RD 661/2007 and the RD 1578/2008 and defined a new remuneration scheme for these assets. After a lost decade for CSP in Europe, Spain announced in its National Energy and Climate Plan the intention of adding 5GW of CSP capacity between 2021 and 2030. [107] Towards this end bi-annual auctions of 200 MW of CSP capacity starting in October 2022 are expected, but details are not yet known. [108]",

[98] [8] In 2016, China announced its intention to build a batch of 20 technologically diverse CSP demonstration projects in the context of the 13th five-year plan , with the intention of building up an internationally competitive CSP industry. [114] Since the first plants were completed in 2018, the generated electricity from the plants with thermal storage is supported with an administratively set FiT of RMB 1.5 per kWh. [115] At the end of 2020, China operated a total of 545 MW in 12 CSP plants, [116] [117] seven plants (320 MW) are molten-salt towers; another two plants (150 MW) use the proven Eurotrough 150 parabolic trough design, [118] three plants (75 MW) use linear Fresnel collectors. Plans to build a second batch of demonstration projects were never enacted and further technology specific support for CSP in the upcoming 14th five-year plan is unknown. Federal support projects from the demonstration batch ran out at the end of 2021. [119]",
