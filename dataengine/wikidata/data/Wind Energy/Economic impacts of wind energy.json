        "text": "Wind is air movement in the Earth's atmosphere. In a unit of time, say 1 second, the volume of air that had passed an area A {\\displaystyle A} is A v {\\displaystyle Av} . If the air density is ρ {\\displaystyle \\rho } , the mass of this volume of air is M = ρ A v {\\displaystyle M=\\rho Av} , and the power transfer, or energy transfer per second is P = 1 2 M v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 {\\displaystyle P={\\tfrac {1}{2}}Mv^{2}={\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\rho Av^{3}} . Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Change of wind speed by a factor of 2.1544 increases the wind power by one order of magnitude (multiply by 10). The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m 2 over the period from 1979 to 2010, 1.31 MJ/m 2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m 2 in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m 2 thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction. [15] Through wind resource assessment , it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential. [13] [16] [17] Unlike 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution. [18] More detailed, site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities. The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. [19] The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there. To assess prospective wind power sites, a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data. [20] Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model. [21]",

        "text": "Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation. Wind power's share of worldwide electricity usage in 2021 was almost 7%, [55] up from 3.5% in 2015. [56] [57] There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage , demand management, and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. [58] These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability. [59] A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually. To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems, for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid . [60] On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored, exported or curtailed. The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include the production of silicon, aluminum, [61] steel, or natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long-term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy . [62] [63] [ better source needed ] Homes and businesses can also be programmed to vary electricity demand , [64] [65] for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats. [66]",

        "text": "Wind power is variable, and during low wind periods, it may need to be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time. Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists but is not as significant. [ citation needed ] Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non- dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve , and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management , load shedding , storage solutions, or system interconnection with HVDC cables. Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation, [67] [68] but car batteries may gain ground from the mid-2020s. [69] Wind power advocates argue that periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. [70] The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world. [71] Solar power tends to be complementary to wind. [73] [74] On daily to weekly timescales, high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. [A] [75] Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. [72] Wind hybrid power systems are becoming more popular. [76]",

Falling prices continue to drive the Levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%. [88] [ needs update ] In 2021, the CEO of Siemens Gamesa warned that increased demand for low-cost wind turbines combined with high input costs and high costs of steel result in increased pressure on the manufacturers and decreasing profit margins.

        "text": "Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs. [91] The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources. [92] However, the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including the cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be more than 20 years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidized, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimizing the use of expensive peaking power plants . [93] The cost has decreased as wind turbine technology has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance, and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital expenditure costs and maintenance costs have continued to decline. [94] In 2021, a Lazard study of unsubsidized electricity said that wind power levelized cost of electricity continues to fall but more slowly than before. The study estimated new wind-generated electricity cost from $26 to $50/MWh, compared to new gas power from $45 to $74/MWh. The median cost of fully deprecated existing coal power was $42/MWh, nuclear $29/MWh and gas $24/MWh. The study estimated offshore wind at around $83/MWh. Compound annual growth rate was 4% per year from 2016 to 2021, compared to 10% per year from 2009 to 2021. [10]",

[102] Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint . Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas. [103] Examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City , where, since 2009, several building projects have capped their roofs with Gorlov-type helical wind turbines . Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings' overall consumption, they help to reinforce the building's 'green' credentials in ways that \"showing people your high-tech boiler\" cannot, with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority . [104] Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs. [105] Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, photovoltaic , or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. [106] Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.

        "text": "The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power . [110] Wind turbines have some of the lowest life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources : far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity, so wind power helps limit climate change. [111] Use of engineered wood may allow carbon negative wind power. [112] Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no local air pollution , unlike fossil fuel power sources. Onshore wind farms can have a significant visual impact. [113] Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements, wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations. [7] [114] Their network of turbines, access roads, transmission lines, and substations can result in \"energy sprawl\"; [8] although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture. [115] [116] Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas, archaeological landscapes and heritage sites. [117] [118] [119] A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views. [120] Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms, [8] but the worldwide ecological impact is minimal. [110] Thousands of birds and bats, including rare species, have been killed by wind turbine blades, [121] though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations. [122] This can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring. [123] Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass , and have a lifetime of 20 years. [124] Blades are hollow: some blades are crushed to reduce their volume and then landfilled. [125] However, as they can take a lot of weight they can be made into long lasting small bridges for walkers or cyclists. [126] Blade end-of-life is complicated, [127] and blades manufactured in the 2020s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable. [128] Wind turbines also generate noise. At a distance of 300 metres (980 ft), this may be around 45 dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At 1.5 km (1 mi), they become inaudible. [129] [130] There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines. [131] Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.

[146] Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation, onshore or near offshore wind farms are sometimes opposed for their impact on the landscape (especially scenic areas, heritage areas and archaeological landscapes), as well as noise, and impact on tourism.

[143] [144] [150] Public support in the United States has decreased from 75% in 2020 to 62% in 2021, with the Democrat Party supporting the use of wind energy twice as much as the Republican Party. [151] President Biden has signed an executive order to begin building large scale wind farms. [152] In China , Shen et al. (2019) found that Chinese city-dwellers may be resistant to building wind turbines in urban areas, with a surprisingly high proportion of people citing an unfounded fear of radiation as driving their concerns. [153] Also, the study finds that like their counterparts in OECD countries, urban Chinese respondents are sensitive to direct costs and wildlife externalities. Distributing relevant information about turbines to the public may alleviate resistance.",

[156] [157] [158] In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects . Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks. [143] [159] [160] Some may still object to wind farms [161] but many say their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by air pollution , [162] [111] climate change [163] and the opinions of the broader community. [164] In the US, wind power projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads, and hospitals, and to revitalize the economies of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners. [98] In the UK, both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms. [165] [166] Some wind farms have become tourist attractions. The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room, a learning hub, a café with a viewing deck and also a shop. It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre . [167] In Denmark, a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine. The loss must be at least 1% of the property's value. [168] Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large, local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. [169] [170] [171] As well as concerns about the landscape, there are concerns that some installations can produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. [172] A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected. [173] While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity, protest groups are often formed to attempt to block some wind power stations for various reasons. [161] [174] [175] Some opposition to wind farms is dismissed as NIMBYism , [176] but research carried out in 2009 found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to wind farms because of a \"Not in my Back Yard\" attitude.

        "text": "The two most important forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, are intermittent energy sources : they are not available constantly, resulting in lower capacity factors . In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

[52] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions , geographic location and time of day. [53] There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal , which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity. [12] PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022. [54] It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, [55] compared to 25 GW of solar thermal. [54] Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building. Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments. China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013. Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19 , growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines. Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.

        "text": "Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC. Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps. Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

[68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

Renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period. [68] To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, IEA believes that 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources. [17] In June 2022 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to \"ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.\" [185] China's five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal. [186] REPowerEU , the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas , is expected to call for much more green hydrogen .

Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy. [199] The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [205] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal . [206] For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\" [207]",

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

[260] [261] [262] Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms.

This means giving communities both a say and a stake.\" [264] In the 2000s and early 2010s, many renewable projects in Germany, Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities, particularly through cooperative structures.

As of 2019, 85% of the world's energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels. [13] Energy production and consumption are responsible for 76% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2018. [14] [15] The 2015 international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global warming to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) and preferably to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F); achieving this goal will require that emissions be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century. [16] The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major source of air pollution, [17] [18] which causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. [19] Fossil-fuel burning in power plants, vehicles, and factories is the main source of emissions that combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to cause acid rain . [20] Air pollution is the second-leading cause of death from non-infectious disease. [21] An estimated 99% of the world's population lives with levels of air pollution that exceed the World Health Organization recommended limits. [22] Cooking with polluting fuels such as wood, animal dung, coal, or kerosene is responsible for nearly all indoor air pollution, which causes an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million deaths annually, [23] [21] and also contributes significantly to outdoor air pollution. [24] Health effects are concentrated among women, who are likely to be responsible for cooking, and young children. [24] Environmental impacts extend beyond the by-products of combustion. Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions. [25] Around 10% of global water use goes to energy production, mainly for cooling in thermal energy plants. In dry regions, this contributes to water scarcity . Bioenergy production, coal mining and processing, and oil extraction also require large amounts of water. [26] Excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material for burning can cause serious local environmental damage, including desertification . [27]",

[36] [37] The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that increasing energy efficiency could achieve 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris Agreement's goals. [38] Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances, vehicles, industrial processes, and buildings. [39] Another approach is to use fewer materials whose production requires a lot of energy, for example through better building design and recycling. Behavioural changes such as using videoconferencing rather than business flights, or making urban trips by cycling, walking or public transport rather than by car, are another way to conserve energy. [40] Government policies to improve efficiency can include building codes , performance standards , carbon pricing , and the development of energy-efficient infrastructure to encourage changes in transport modes . [40] [41] The energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product (GDP)) is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production. [42] In 2010, global energy intensity was 5.6 megajoules (1.6 kWh ) per US dollar of GDP. [42] United Nations goals call for energy intensity to decrease by 2.6% each year between 2010 and 2030. [43] In recent years this target has not been met. For instance, between 2017 and 2018, energy intensity decreased by only 1.1%. [43] Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services. [44] For example, recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour , such as selecting larger vehicles and homes. [45]",

[60] In 2019, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity, [61] mostly through solar panels based on photovoltaic cells (PV). Solar PV is expected to be the electricity source with the largest installed capacity worldwide by 2027. [59] The panels are mounted on top of buildings or installed in utility-scale solar parks . Costs of solar photovoltaic cells have dropped rapidly, driving strong growth in worldwide capacity. [62] The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places, cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants. [63] Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix. [64] [65] Most components of solar panels can be easily recycled, but this is not always done in the absence of regulation. [66] Panels typically contain heavy metals , so they pose environmental risks if put in landfills . [67] It takes fewer than two years for a solar panel to produce as much energy as was used for its production. Less energy is needed if materials are recycled rather than mined. [68] In concentrated solar power , solar rays are concentrated by a field of mirrors, heating a fluid. Electricity is produced from the resulting steam with a heat engine . Concentrated solar power can support dispatchable power generation , as some of the heat is typically stored to enable electricity to be generated when needed. [69] [70] In addition to electricity production, solar energy is used more directly; solar thermal heating systems are used for hot water production, heating buildings, drying, and desalination.

[72] Modern wind turbines are used to generate electricity and provided approximately 6% of global electricity in 2019. [61] Electricity from onshore wind farms is often cheaper than existing coal plants and competitive with natural gas and nuclear. [63] Wind turbines can also be placed offshore, where winds are steadier and stronger than on land but construction and maintenance costs are higher. [73] Onshore wind farms, often built in wild or rural areas, have a visual impact on the landscape. [74] While collisions with wind turbines kill both bats and to a lesser extent birds, these impacts are lower than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines . [75] [76] The noise and flickering light created by the turbines can cause annoyance and constrain construction near densely populated areas. Wind power, in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants, does not consume water. [77] Little energy is needed for wind turbine construction compared to the energy produced by the wind power plant itself. [78] Turbine blades are not fully recyclable, and research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing. [79]",

In 2020, hydropower supplied 17% of the world's electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to-late 20th century. [80] [81] In conventional hydropower, a reservoir is created behind a dam. Conventional hydropower plants provide a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply. They can be combined with wind and solar power to meet peaks in demand and to compensate when wind and sun are less available. [82] Compared to reservoir-based facilities, run-of-the-river hydroelectricity generally has less environmental impact. However, its ability to generate power depends on river flow, which can vary with daily and seasonal weather. Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation. [83] Hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects. [84] The highest emissions tend to occur with large dams in tropical regions. [85] These emissions are produced when the biological matter that becomes submerged in the reservoir's flooding decomposes and releases carbon dioxide and methane. Deforestation and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams. [82] Depending on location, large dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage; potential dam failure could place the surrounding population at risk. [82]",

[87] Power is produced from the steam created in underground reservoirs. [88] Geothermal energy provided less than 1% of global energy consumption in 2020.

[90] On average, the greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal-based electricity are less than 5% that of coal-based electricity.

        "text": "Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. [92] It can either be burned to produce heat and electricity or be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, which can be used to power vehicles. [93] [94] The climate impact of bioenergy varies considerably depending on where biomass feedstocks come from and how they are grown. [95] For example, burning wood for energy releases carbon dioxide; those emissions can be significantly offset if the trees that were harvested are replaced by new trees in a well-managed forest, as the new trees will absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. [96] However, the establishment and cultivation of bioenergy crops can displace natural ecosystems , degrade soils , and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers. [97] [98] Approximately one-third of all wood used for traditional heating and cooking in tropical areas is harvested unsustainably. [99] Bioenergy feedstocks typically require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport; the energy usage for these processes may emit greenhouse gases. In some cases, the impacts of land-use change , cultivation, and processing can result in higher overall carbon emissions for bioenergy compared to using fossil fuels. [98] [100] Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food . In the United States, around 10% of motor gasoline has been replaced by corn-based ethanol , which requires a significant proportion of the harvest. [101] [102] In Malaysia and Indonesia, clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects , as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for diverse species. [103] [104] Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight, producing a given amount of bioenergy requires a large amount of land compared to other renewable energy sources. [105] Second-generation biofuels which are produced from non-food plants or waste reduce competition with food production, but may have other negative effects including trade-offs with conservation areas and local air pollution. [95] Relatively sustainable sources of biomass include algae , waste, and crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production. [95] Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants. This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would require converting large amounts of cropland. [106]",

[123] As of 2019, nuclear generated over a quarter of all low-carbon energy , making it the second largest source after hydropower. [89] Nuclear power's lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions—including the mining and processing of uranium —are similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources. [84] Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables.  Additionally, Nuclear power does not create local air pollution. [124] [125] Although the uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, enough exists to provide a supply for hundreds to thousands of years. [126] [127] However, uranium resources that can be accessed in an economically feasible manner, at the present state, are limited and uranium production could hardly keep up during the expansion phase. [128] Climate change mitigation pathways consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear. [129] There is controversy over whether nuclear power is sustainable, in part due to concerns around nuclear waste , nuclear weapon proliferation , and accidents . [130] Radioactive nuclear waste must be managed for thousands of years [130] and nuclear power plants create fissile material that can be used for weapons. [130] For each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy has caused far fewer accidental and pollution-related deaths than fossil fuels, and the historic fatality rate of nuclear is comparable to renewable sources. [115] Public opposition to nuclear energy often makes nuclear plants politically difficult to implement. [130] Reducing the time and the cost of building new nuclear plants have been goals for decades but costs remain high and timescales long. [131] Various new forms of nuclear energy are in development, hoping to address the drawbacks of conventional plants. Fast breeder reactors are capable of recycling nuclear waste and therefore can significantly reduce the amount of waste that requires geological disposal , but have not yet been deployed on a large-scale commercial basis. [132] Nuclear power based on thorium (rather than uranium) may be able to provide higher energy security for countries that do not have a large supply of uranium. [133] Small modular reactors may have several advantages over current large reactors: It should be possible to build them faster and their modularization would allow for cost reductions via learning-by-doing . [134] Several countries are attempting to develop nuclear fusion reactors, which would generate small amounts of waste and no risk of explosions. [135] Although fusion power has taken steps forward in the lab, the multi-decade timescale needed to bring it to commercialization and then scale means it will not contribute to a 2050 net zero goal for climate change mitigation.

[13] For a society to replace one form of energy with another, multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change. For example, transitioning from oil to solar power as the energy source for cars requires the generation of solar electricity, modifications to the electrical grid to accommodate fluctuations in solar panel output or the introduction of variable battery chargers and higher overall demand, adoption of electric cars , and networks of electric vehicle charging facilities and repair shops. [138] Many climate change mitigation pathways envision three main aspects of a low-carbon energy system: Some energy-intensive technologies and processes are difficult to electrify, including aviation, shipping, and steelmaking. There are several options for reducing the emissions from these sectors: biofuels and synthetic carbon-neutral fuels can power many vehicles that are designed to burn fossil fuels, however biofuels cannot be sustainably produced in the quantities needed and synthetic fuels are currently very expensive. [140] For some applications, the most prominent alternative to electrification is to develop a system based on sustainably-produced hydrogen fuel . [141] Full decarbonisation of the global energy system is expected to take several decades and can mostly be achieved with existing technologies. [142] In the IEA's proposal for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, about 35% of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of 2023. [143] Technologies that are relatively immature include batteries  and processes to create carbon-neutral fuels. [144] [145] Developing new technologies requires research and development, demonstration , and cost reductions via deployment . [144] The transition to a zero-carbon energy system will bring strong co-benefits for human health: The World Health Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions of lives each year from reductions to air pollution alone. [146] [147] With good planning and management, pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030 in ways that are consistent with climate goals. [148] [149] Historically, several countries have made rapid economic gains through coal usage. [148] However, there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to \" leapfrog \" fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables, given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer.

[152] As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. [153] In 2019, these sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity, a share that has grown rapidly. [61] There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale: there is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low. [153] Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability. [154] Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids , matching the times when variable energy production is highest. With grid energy storage , energy produced in excess can be released when needed. [153] Further flexibility could be provided from sector coupling , that is coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat -systems and electric vehicles. [155] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather. In optimal weather, energy generation may have to be curtailed if excess electricity cannot be used or stored. The final demand-supply mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower, bioenergy, or natural gas. [156]",

[165] One of the challenges in providing universal access to electricity is distributing power to rural areas. Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy, such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village, are important solutions. [166] Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world. [167] Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals, such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels.

[188] [189] Promoting non-motorised transport such as walking and cycling, particularly in cities, can make transport cleaner and healthier. [190] [191] The energy efficiency of cars has increased over time, [192] but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution. [193] A large proportion of traffic-related air pollution consists of particulate matter from road dust and the wearing-down of tyres and brake pads. [194] Substantially reducing pollution from these non-tailpipe sources cannot be achieved by electrification; it requires measures such as making vehicles lighter and driving them less. [195] Light-duty cars in particular are a prime candidate for decarbonization using battery technology . 25% of the world's CO 2 emissions still originate from the transportation sector. [196] Long-distance freight transport and aviation are difficult sectors to electrify with current technologies, mostly because of the weight of batteries needed for long-distance travel, battery recharging times, and limited battery lifespans. [197] [160] Where available, freight transport by ship and rail is generally more sustainable than by air and by road. [198] Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles such as lorries. [199] Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviation are still early in their development, with ammonia (produced from hydrogen) a promising candidate for shipping fuel. [200] Aviation biofuel may be one of the better uses of bioenergy if emissions are captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel. [201]",

[205] To heat buildings, alternatives to burning fossil fuels and biomass include electrification through heat pumps or electric heaters , geothermal energy , central solar heating , reuse of waste heat , and seasonal thermal energy storage . [206] [207] [208] Heat pumps provide both heat and air conditioning through a single appliance. [209] The IEA estimates heat pumps could provide over 90% of space and water heating requirements globally. [210] A highly efficient way to heat buildings is through district heating , in which heat is generated in a centralised location and then distributed to multiple buildings through insulated pipes . Traditionally, most district heating systems have used fossil fuels, but modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use high shares of renewable energy. [211] [212] Cooling of buildings can be made more efficient through passive building design , planning that minimises the urban heat island effect, and district cooling systems that cool multiple buildings with piped cold water. [213] [214] Air conditioning requires large amounts of electricity and is not always affordable for poorer households. [214] Some air conditioning units still use refrigerants that are greenhouse gases, as some countries have not ratified the Kigali Amendment to only use climate-friendly refrigerants. [215] In developing countries where populations suffer from energy poverty , polluting fuels such as wood or animal dung are often used for cooking. Cooking with these fuels is generally unsustainable, because they release harmful smoke and because harvesting wood can lead to forest degradation. [216] The universal adoption of clean cooking facilities, which are already ubiquitous in rich countries, [203] would dramatically improve health and have minimal negative effects on climate. [217] [218] Clean cooking facilities, e.g. cooking facilities that produce less indoor soot, typically use natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (both of which consume oxygen and produce carbon-dioxide) or electricity as the energy source; biogas systems are a promising alternative in some contexts. [203] Improved cookstoves that burn biomass more efficiently than traditional stoves are an interim solution where transitioning to clean cooking systems is difficult. [219]",

        "text": "Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security and lessen the financial burden of using energy. [226] Environmental regulations have been used since the 1970s to promote more sustainable use of energy. [227] Some governments have committed to dates for phasing out coal-fired power plants and ending new fossil fuel exploration . Governments can require that new cars produce zero emissions, or new buildings are heated by electricity instead of gas. [228] Renewable portfolio standards in several countries require utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources. [229] [230] Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as long-distance electrical transmission lines, smart grids, and hydrogen pipelines. [231] In transport, appropriate infrastructure and incentives can make travel more efficient and less car-dependent. [226] Urban planning that discourages sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality of life. [226] Government-funded research, procurement, and incentive policies have historically been critical to the development and maturation of clean energy technologies, such as solar and lithium batteries. [232] In the IEA's scenario for a net zero-emission energy system by 2050, public funding is rapidly mobilised to bring a range of newer technologies to the demonstration phase and to encourage deployment. [233] Carbon pricing (such as a tax on CO 2 emissions) gives industries and consumers an incentive to reduce emissions while letting them choose how to do so. For example, they can shift to low-emission energy sources, improve energy efficiency, or reduce their use of energy-intensive products and services. [234] Carbon pricing has encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer. [235] [236] Most studies indicate that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, carbon pricing would need to be complemented by stringent energy-specific policies. [237] As of 2019, the price of carbon in most regions is too low to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. [238] Carbon taxes provide a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes [239] or help lower-income households afford higher energy costs. [240] Some governments, such as the EU and the UK, are exploring the use of carbon border adjustments . [241] These place tariffs on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies, to ensure that industries subject to internal carbon prices remain competitive. [242] [243] The scale and pace of policy reforms that have been initiated as of 2020 are far less than needed to fulfil the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. [244] [245] In addition to domestic policies, greater international cooperation is required to accelerate innovation and to assist poorer countries in establishing a sustainable path to full energy access. [246] Countries may support renewables to create jobs. [247] The International Labour Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 2 °C would result in net job creation in most sectors of the economy. [248] It predicts that 24 million new jobs would be created by 2030 in areas such as renewable electricity generation, improving energy-efficiency in buildings, and the transition to electric vehicles. Six million jobs would be lost, in sectors such as mining and fossil fuels. [248] Governments can make the transition to sustainable energy more politically and socially feasible by ensuring a just transition for workers and regions that depend on the fossil fuel industry, to ensure they have alternative economic opportunities.

[250] The IPCC estimates that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, US$2.4 trillion would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035. Most studies project that these costs, equivalent to 2.5% of world GDP, would be small compared to the economic and health benefits. [251] Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be six times more by 2050 compared to 2015. [252] Underfunding is particularly acute in the least developed countries, which are not attractive to the private sector. [253] The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimates that climate financing totalled $681 billion in 2016. [254] Most of this is private-sector investment in renewable energy deployment, public-sector investment in sustainable transport, and private-sector investment in energy efficiency. [255] The Paris Agreement includes a pledge of an extra $100 billion per year from developed countries to poor countries, to do climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, this goal has not been met and measurement of progress has been hampered by unclear accounting rules. [256] [257] If energy-intensive businesses like chemicals, fertilizers, ceramics, steel, and non-ferrous metals invest significantly in R&D, its usage in industry might amount to between 5% and 20% of all energy used. [258] [259] Fossil fuel funding and subsidies are a significant barrier to the energy transition. [260] [250] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies were $319 billion in 2017. This rises to $5.2 trillion when indirect costs are priced in, like the effects of air pollution. [261] Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths. [262] Funding for clean energy has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic , and pandemic-related economic stimulus packages offer possibilities for a green recovery . [263] [264]",

[67] Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. [68] The integration of larger amounts of solar and wind energy into the grid requires a change of the energy system; this is necessary to ensure that the supply of electricity matches demand. [69] There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale. There is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low. [69] Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines also makes it possible to reduce variability. [70] It is possible to shift energy demand in time. Energy demand management and the use of smart grids make it possible to match the times when variable energy production is highest. [69] Sector coupling can provide further flexibility. This involves coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat -systems and electric vehicles. [71] Energy storage helps overcome barriers to intermittent renewable energy. [72] The most commonly used and available storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity . This requires locations with large differences in height and access to water. [72] Batteries are also in wide use. [73] They typically store electricity for short periods.

In transport and electricity production, fossil fuel usage has a low efficiency of less than 50%. Large amounts of heat in power plants and in motors of vehicles go to waste. The actual amount of energy consumed is significantly lower at 116,000 TWh. [98] Energy conservation is the effort made to reduce the consumption of energy by using less of an energy service. One way is to use energy more efficiently . This means using less energy than before to produce the same service. Another way is to reduce the amount of service used. An example of this would be to drive less. Energy conservation is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy . [99] When consumers reduce wastage and losses they can conserve energy. The upgrading of technology as well as the improvements to operations and maintenance can result in overall efficiency improvements. Efficient energy use (or energy efficiency ) is the process of reducing the amount of energy required to provide products and services. Improved energy efficiency in buildings (\"green buildings\"), industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third. This would help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. [100] For example, insulating a building allows it to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain thermal comfort. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process.

[112] The widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could cut food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2050. [113] China introduced new dietary guidelines in 2016 which aim to cut meat consumption by 50% and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 Gt per year by 2030. [114] Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions. It is responsible for nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint. Almost 15% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have been attributed to the livestock sector. [108] A shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate climate change. [115] In particular, reducing meat consumption would help to reduce methane emissions. [116] If high-income nations switched to a plant-based diet, vast amounts of land used for animal agriculture could be allowed to return to their natural state . This in turn has the potential to sequester 100 billion tonnes of CO 2 by the end of the century. [117] [118] A comprehensive analysis found that plant based diets reduce emissions, water pollution and land use significantly (by 75%), while reducing the destruction of wildlife and usage of water.

[7] This refers to the management of Earth's natural carbon sinks in a way that preserves or increases their capability to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and to store it durably. Scientists call this process also carbon sequestration . In the context of climate change mitigation, the IPCC defines a sink as \"Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere\". [13] : 2249 Globally, the two most important carbon sinks are vegetation and the ocean . [123] To enhance the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon, changes are necessary in agriculture and forestry. [124] Examples are preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation . [125] : 266 Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century. [126] : 1068 [127] : 17 There are concerns about over-reliance on these technologies, and their environmental impacts. [127] : 17 [128] : 34 But ecosystem restoration and reduced conversion are among the mitigation tools that can yield the most emissions reductions before 2030. [7] : 43 Land-based mitigation options are referred to as \"AFOLU mitigation options\" in the 2022 IPCC report on mitigation. The abbreviation stands for \"agriculture, forestry and other land use\" [7] : 37 The report described the economic mitigation potential from relevant activities around forests and ecosystems as follows: \"the conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems (coastal wetlands, peatlands , savannas and grasslands)\". A high mitigation potential is found for reducing deforestation in tropical regions. The economic potential of these activities has been estimated to be 4.2 to 7.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO 2 -eq) per year. [7] : 37",

[129] About 95% of deforestation occurs in the tropics, where clearing of land for agriculture is one of the main causes. [130] One forest conservation strategy is to transfer rights over land from public ownership to its indigenous inhabitants. [131] Land concessions often go to powerful extractive companies. [131] Conservation strategies that exclude and even evict humans, called fortress conservation , often lead to more exploitation of the land. This is because the native inhabitants turn to work for extractive companies to survive. [132] Proforestation is promoting forests to capture their full ecological potential. [133] This is a mitigation strategy as secondary forests that have regrown in abandoned farmland are found to have less biodiversity than the original old-growth forests .  Original forests store 60% more carbon than these new forests. [134] Strategies include rewilding and establishing wildlife corridors . [135] [136]",

        "text": "Afforestation is the establishment of trees where there was previously no tree cover. Scenarios for new plantations covering up to 4000 million hectares (Mha) (6300 x 6300 km) suggest cumulative carbon storage of more than 900 GtC (2300 GtCO 2 ) until 2100. [137] But they are not a viable alternative to aggressive emissions reduction. [138] This is because the plantations would need to be so large they would eliminate most natural ecosystems or reduce food production. [139] One example is the Trillion Tree Campaign . [140] [141] However, preserving biodiversity is also important and for example not all grasslands are suitable for conversion into forests. [142] Grasslands can even turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources . [143] Reforestation is the restocking of existing depleted forests or in places where there were recently forests. Reforestation could save at least 1 GtCO 2 per year, at an estimated cost of $5–15 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO 2 ). [146] Restoring all degraded forests all over the world could capture about 205 GtC (750 GtCO 2 ). [147] With increased intensive agriculture and urbanization , there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every acre of original old-growth forest cut down, more than 50 acres of new secondary forests are growing. [134] [148] In some countries, promoting regrowth on abandoned farmland could offset years of emissions. [149] Planting new trees can be expensive and a risky investment. For example, about 80 percent of planted trees in the Sahel die within two years. [144] Reforestation has higher carbon storage potential than afforestation. Even long-deforested areas still contain an \"underground forest\" of living roots and tree stumps. Helping native species sprout naturally is cheaper than planting new trees and they are more likely to survive. This could include pruning and coppicing to accelerate growth. This also provides woodfuel, which is otherwise a major source of deforestation. Such practices, called farmer-managed natural regeneration , are centuries old but the biggest obstacle towards implementation is ownership of the trees by the state. The state often sells timber rights to businesses which leads to locals uprooting seedlings because they see them as a liability. Legal aid for locals [150] [151] and changes to property law such as in Mali and Niger have led to significant changes. Scientists describe them as the largest positive environmental transformation in Africa. It is possible to discern from space the border between Niger and the more barren land in Nigeria, where the law has not changed. [144] [145]",

        "text": "In addition to traditional land-based methods to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the air, other technologies are under development. These could reduce CO 2 emissions and lower existing atmospheric CO 2 levels. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing CO 2 from large point sources , such as cement factories or biomass power plants. It then stores it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS. [183] Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) expands on the potential of CCS and aims to lower atmospheric CO 2 levels. This process uses biomass grown for bioenergy . The biomass yields energy in useful forms such as electricity, heat, biofuels, etc. through consumption of the biomass via combustion, fermentation, or pyrolysis. The process captures the CO 2 that was extracted from the atmosphere when it grew. It then stores it underground or via land application as biochar . This effectively removes it from the atmosphere . [184] This makes BECCS a negative emissions technology (NET). [185] Scientists estimated the potential range of negative emissions from BECCS in 2018 as 0–22 Gt per year. [186] As of 2022 [update] , BECCS was capturing approximately 2 million tonnes per year of CO 2 annually. [187] The cost and availability of biomass limits wide deployment of BECCS. [188] [189] : 10 BECCS currently forms a big part of achieving climate targets beyond 2050 in modelling, such as by the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) associated with the IPCC process. But many scientists are sceptical due to the risk of loss of biodiversity. [190] Direct air capture is a process of capturing CO 2 directly from the ambient air. This is in contrast to CCS which captures carbon from point sources. It generates a concentrated stream of CO 2 for sequestration , utilization or production of carbon-neutral fuel and windgas . [191] Artificial processes vary, and there are concerns about the long-term effects of some of these processes. [192] [ obsolete source ]",

By 2020, aviation emissions were 70% higher than in 2005 and they could grow by 300% by 2050. [224] It is possible to reduce aviation's environmental footprint by better fuel economy in aircraft . Optimising flight routes to lower non-CO 2 effects on climate from nitrogen oxides, particulates or contrails can also help. Aviation biofuel , carbon emission trading and carbon offsetting , part of the 191 nation ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), can lower CO 2 emissions. Short-haul flight bans , train connections, personal choices and taxation on flights can lead to fewer flights.

A growing number of countries raise a fixed carbon tax or participate in dynamic carbon emission trading (ETS) systems. In 2021, more than 21% of global greenhouse gas emissions were covered by a carbon price. This was a big increase from earlier due to the introduction of the Chinese national carbon trading scheme . [301] : 23 Trading schemes offer the possibility to limit emission allowances to certain reduction targets. However, an oversupply of allowances keeps most ETS at low price levels around $10 with a low impact. This includes the Chinese ETS which started with $7/tCO 2 in 2021. [302] One exception is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme where prices began to rise in 2018. They reached about €80/tCO 2 in 2022. [303] This results in additional costs of about €0.04/KWh for coal and €0.02/KWh for gas combustion for electricity, depending on the emission intensity .

[21] The first use of the term \"fossil fuel\" occurs in the work of the German chemist Caspar Neumann , in English translation in 1759. [22] The Oxford English Dictionary notes that in the phrase \"fossil fuel\" the adjective \"fossil\" means \"[o]btained by digging; found buried in the earth\", which dates to at least 1652, [23] before the English noun \"fossil\" came to refer primarily to long-dead organisms in the early 18th century. [24] Aquatic phytoplankton and zooplankton that died and sedimented in large quantities under anoxic conditions millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of anaerobic decomposition . Over geological time this organic matter , mixed with mud , became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment. The resulting high temperature and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter , first into a waxy material known as kerogen , which is found in oil shales , and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis . Despite these heat-driven transformations, the energy released in combustion is still photosynthetic in origin. [4] Terrestrial plants tended to form coal and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the Carboniferous period of Earth's history . Terrestrial plants also form type III kerogen , a source of natural gas. Although fossil fuels are continually formed by natural processes, they are classified as non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are generated.

        "text": "Fossil fuels have been important to human development because they can be readily burned in the open atmosphere to produce heat. The use of peat as a domestic fuel predates recorded history. Coal was burned in some early furnaces for the smelting of metal ore , while semi-solid hydrocarbons from oil seeps were also burned in ancient times, [29] they were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming . [30] Commercial exploitation of petroleum began in the 19th century. [31] Natural gas, once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource. [32] Natural gas deposits are also the main source of helium . Heavy crude oil , which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and oil sands , where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel in the early 2000s. [33] Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen , a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated ( pyrolyzed ). With additional processing, they can be employed instead of other established fossil fuels. During the 2010s and 2020s there was disinvestment from exploitation of such resources due to their high carbon cost relative to more easily-processed reserves. [34] Prior to the latter half of the 18th century, windmills and watermills provided the energy needed for work such as milling flour, sawing wood or pumping water, while burning wood or peat provided domestic heat. The wide-scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, in steam engines enabled the Industrial Revolution . At the same time, gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use. The invention of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles and trucks greatly increased the demand for gasoline and diesel oil , both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, railways and aircraft, also require fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in generating electricity and as feedstock for the petrochemical industry . Tar , a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in the construction of roads . The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon -fueled irrigation . [35] [36] The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth ; it has been estimated that almost half of the Earth's population are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. [37] According to head of a fertilizers commodity price agency, \"50% of the world's food relies on fertilisers.\" [38]",

        "section": "Environmental effects",
        "text": "The burning of fossil fuels has a number of negative externalities – harmful environmental impacts where the effects extend beyond the people using the fuel. These effects vary between different fuels. All fossil fuels release CO 2 when they burn, thus accelerating climate change . Burning coal, and to a lesser extent oil and its derivatives, contributes to atmospheric particulate matter , smog and acid rain . [39] [40] [41] Climate change is largely driven by the release of greenhouse gases like CO 2 , and the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these emissions. In most parts of the world climate change is negatively impacting ecosystems . [44] This includes contributing to the extinction of species and reducing people's ability to produce food, thus adding to the problem of world hunger . Continued rises in global temperatures will lead to further adverse effects on both ecosystems and people; the World Health Organization has said that climate change is the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century. [45] [46] Combustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric and nitric acids , which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve calcium carbonate . Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly uranium and thorium , which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 tonnes of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. [47] It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island accident . [48] Burning coal also generates large amounts of bottom ash and fly ash . These materials are used in a wide variety of applications (see Fly ash reuse ), utilizing, for example, [ clarification needed ] about 40% of the United States production. [49] In addition to the effects that result from burning, the harvesting, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels also have environmental effects. Coal mining methods, particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining , have negative environmental impacts, and offshore oil drilling poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. Fossil fuel wells can contribute to methane release via fugitive gas emissions . Oil refineries also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Coal is sometimes transported by diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, requiring the combustion of additional fossil fuels. A variety of mitigating efforts have arisen to counter the negative effects of fossil fuels. This includes a movement to use alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy . Environmental regulation uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions; for example, rules against releasing waste products like fly ash into the atmosphere. [41] In December 2020, the United Nations released a report saying that despite the need to reduce greenhouse emissions, various governments are \" doubling down \" on fossil fuels, in some cases diverting over 50% of their COVID-19 recovery stimulus funding to fossil fuel production rather than to alternative energy. The UN secretary general António Guterres declared that \"Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury.\" He also claimed there is still cause for hope, anticipating the US plan to join other large emitters like China and the EU in adopting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

[54] Global air pollution deaths due to fossil fuels have been estimated at over 8 million people (2018, nearly 1 in 5 deaths worldwide) [55] at 10.2 million (2019), [56] and 5.13 million excess deaths from ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use (2023). [57] While all energy sources inherently have adverse effects, the data show that fossil fuels cause the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions and are the most dangerous for human health. In contrast, modern renewable energy sources appear to be safer for human health and cleaner. The death rates from accidents and air pollution in the EU are as follows per terawatt-hour (TWh): [58] As the data shows, coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass cause higher death rates and higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than hydropower, nuclear energy, wind, and solar power. Scientists propose that 1.8 million lives have been saved by replacing fossil fuel sources with nuclear power. [59]",

        "text": "A typical study of a wind farm's Life cycle assessment , when not connected to the electric grid, usually results in similar findings as the following 2006 analysis of 3 installations in the US Midwest, where the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions of wind power ranged from 14 to 33 tonnes (15 to 36 short tons) per GWh (14–33 g CO 2 / kWh ) of energy produced, with most of the CO 2 emission intensity coming from producing steel, concrete, and plastic/fiberglass composites for the turbine structure and foundation. [40] [41] By combining similar data from numerous individual studies in a meta-analysis , the median global warming potential for wind power was found to be 11–12 g CO 2 /kWh and unlikely to change significantly. [36] [42] [43] This higher dependence on back-up/ Load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the knock-on-effect of more frequent inefficient (in CO 2 e g/kWh) throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent power source's variable output. When one includes the total effect of intermittent sources on other power sources in the grid system, that is, including these inefficient start up emissions of backup power sources to cater for wind energy, into wind energy's total system-wide life cycle, this results in a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity. Higher than the direct g/kWh value that is determined from looking at the power source in isolation and thus ignores all down-stream detrimental/inefficiency effects it has on the grid. This higher dependence on back-up/ Load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output forces fossil power plants to operate in less efficient states. [42] [ better source needed ] In comparison to other low carbon power sources wind turbines, when assessed in isolation, have a median life cycle emission value of between 11 and 12 ( g CO 2 eq / kWh ). [36] [44] While an increase in emissions due to the practical issues of load balancing is an issue, Pehnt et al. still conclude that these 20 and 80 g CO 2 -eq/kWh added penalties still result in wind being roughly ten times less polluting than fossil gas and coal which emit ~400 and 900 g CO 2 -eq/kWh respectively. [45] As these losses occur due to the cycling of fossil power plants, they may at some point become smaller when more than 20–30% of wind energy is added to the power grid, as fossil power plants are replaced, however this has yet to occur in practice.

        "text": "As much as 80% of the wind turbine structure can be recycled , though this does not include the foundation of the structure, which is typically made from reinforced concrete , or the blades. [67] Alternatively, these components of the turbine structure that are not easily recycled into new turbines can still be repurposed and used in other ways. [68] The large volume of the turbine blades, while difficult to handle, is advantageous in repurposing the blades as playground structures, bike shelters and footbridges . Other recycling methods include creating pellets for waterproof boards and injectable plastics , as well as pyrolysis for producing paints , glues , and both cement and concrete . [69] [70] [71] Carbon fiber blades can now be recycled , the fiber first being separated from the epoxy resin binder , then chopped into small particles. After the separation , the resin is used as a fuel source for the next materials to be processed. [72] After pyrolysis, the resulting material can be further separated and the glass fibers extracted to be used in insulation or fiber reinforcement. [73] The blades may also be repurposed into building materials and structural components. [74] Research indicates that turbine blades could successfully be repurposed as electrical transmission poles as their strength and structural stability was found to be comparable to the materials that are typically used. [75] Sections of the blades have been adapted to create roofs for small houses and these structures meet the requirements of building codes and may prove to be a viable way to reuse blade materials without extensive processes needed to make the material usable. [76] Components of the turbine could be reused by implementing segmentation, where the object is divided into different elements. [77] Research on segmentation suggests that the resulting materials are better than conventional construction materials when measuring specific flexural stiffness and flexural strength . [77] Overall, there are several different avenues through which wind turbine components can be recycled, reused, or repurposed, all with their advantages and disadvantages, and there continues to be research conducted to determine even more ways that the materials can be economically used. While various methods for recycling or repurposing the turbine blades have been proven effective, they have not been implemented on a large enough scale to adequately address the rapidly rising amounts of turbine blade waste being produced.

Displacement is thought to be more of a threat to species than collisions. [109] Habitat loss is highly variable between species. [110] [111] Hundreds of thousands of birds, [112] [113] [114] including raptors and migrants, [115] [116] [117] are killed each year because of wind turbines and their power lines, [20] but this is less than the number killed (or not born) because of fossil fuel (coal and gas) infrastructure. [118] [22] Wind farms are estimated to be responsible for losing less than 0.4 birds per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity generated, compared to over 5 birds per GWh for fossil fueled power stations. [119] As well as threatening extinction, [120] one of the effects of climate change is to already cause a decline in bird population, [121] and this is the main cause of bird loss from fossil power. [122] [18] [107] [123] A study comparing annually recorded bird populations in the United States from 2000 to 2020 to the spread of wind power infrastructure, found the presence of wind turbines had no significant effect on bird population numbers. This was directly compared to fracking infrastructure, whose presence causes a 15% decrease in the local bird populations. [124] On some important migration routes turbines are banned, or birds may alter their flight paths to avoid them. [125] Biological surveys beforehand and correctly siting turbines is important, especially for raptors as they are slow to breed. [118] Methods to help birds avoid turbines include painting of one of the turbine blades black, [126] and making ultrasonic noise. [127] Some approaching birds can be spotted, for example by avian radar, [128] [129] in time for turbines to be slowed to a speed which is safe for them. [130] Wind farms may need more power lines, and lines may be made less damaging to compensate. [131] [132] Making permits for the number of birds (such as eagles) killed tradeable has been suggested, in order to save the most birds at the least cost. [133]",

[158] To some, the perceived aesthetic aspects of wind power stations may conflict with the protection of historical sites. [159] Wind power stations are less likely to be perceived negatively in urbanized and industrial regions. [160] Aesthetic issues are subjective and some people find wind farms pleasant or see them as symbols of energy independence and local prosperity. [161] While studies in Scotland predict wind farms will damage tourism, [162] in other countries some wind farms have themselves become tourist attractions, [163] [164] [165] with several having visitor centers at ground level or even observation decks atop turbine towers. In the 1980s, wind energy was being discussed as part of a soft energy path . [166] Renewable energy commercialization led to an increasing industrial image of wind power, which is being criticized by various stakeholders in the planning process, including nature protection associations. [167] Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations. Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses. Coastal areas and areas of higher altitude such as ridgelines are considered prime for wind farms, due to constant wind speeds. However, both locations tend to be areas of high visual impact and can be a contributing factor in local communities' resistance to some projects. Both the proximity to densely populated areas and the necessary wind speeds make coastal locations ideal for wind farms. [168] Wind power stations can impact on important sight relations which are a key part of culturally important landscapes, such as in the Rhine Gorge or Moselle valley . [169] Conflicts between the heritage status of certain areas and wind power projects have arisen in various countries. In 2011 UNESCO raised concerns regarding a proposed wind farm 17 kilometres away from the French island abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel . [170] In Germany, the impact of wind farms on valuable cultural landscapes has implications on zoning and land-use planning . [169] [171] For example, sensitive parts of the Moselle valley and the background of the Hambach Castle , according to the plans of the state government, will be kept free of wind turbines. [172] Wind turbines require aircraft warning lights , which may create light pollution . Complaints about these lights have caused the US FAA to consider allowing fewer lights per turbine in certain areas. [173] Residents near turbines may complain of \"shadow flicker\" caused by rotating turbine blades, when the sun passes behind the turbine. This can be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or by turning the turbine off for the time of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker. If a turbine is poorly sited and adjacent to many homes, the duration of shadow flicker on a neighbourhood can last hours. [174]",

[17] Low emission industrial development and resource efficiency can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP) , there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies, with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5–5 years, leveraging financial investment.

        "text": "The economics of nuclear power are debated.\nSome opponents of nuclear power cite cost as the main challenge for the technology. Ian Lowe has also challenged the economics of nuclear power. [8] [9] Nuclear supporters point to the historical success of nuclear power across the world, and they call for new reactors in their own countries, including proposed new but largely uncommercialized designs, as a source of new power. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) endorses nuclear technology as a low carbon, mature energy source which should be nearly quadrupled to help address soaring greenhouse gas emissions . [17] Solar power has very low capacity factors compared to nuclear, and solar power can only achieve so much market penetration before (expensive) energy storage and transmission become necessary. This is because nuclear power \"requires less maintenance and is designed to operate for longer stretches before refueling\" while solar power is in a constant state of refueling and is limited by a lack of fuel that requires a backup power source that works on a larger scale. [18] In the United States, nuclear power faces competition from the low natural gas prices in North America. Former Exelon CEO John Rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States \"don’t make any sense right now\" and won't be economic as long as the natural gas surplus persists. [19] The price of new plants in China is lower than in the Western world. [20] In 2016, the Governor of New York , Andrew Cuomo , directed the New York Public Service Commission to consider ratepayer-financed subsidies similar to those for renewable sources to keep nuclear power stations (which accounted for one third of the state's generation, and half of its emissions-free generation) profitable in the competition against natural gas plants, which have replaced nuclear plants when they closed in other states. [21] A study in 2019 by the economic think tank DIW Berlin , found that nuclear power has not been profitable anywhere in the world. [22] [ unreliable source? ] The study of the economics of nuclear power has found it has never been financially viable, that most plants have been built while heavily subsidised by governments, often motivated by military purposes, and that nuclear power is not a good approach to tackling climate change. It found, after reviewing trends in nuclear power plant construction since 1951, that the average 1,000MW nuclear power plant would incur an average economic loss of 4.8 billion euros ($7.7 billion AUD). This has been refuted by another study. [23]",

        "text": "Generally, a nuclear power plant is significantly more expensive to build than an equivalent coal-fueled or gas-fueled plant. If natural gas is plentiful and cheap, the operating costs of conventional power plants is less. [82] Most forms of electricity generation produce some form of negative externality costs imposed on third parties that are not directly paid by the producer such as pollution which negatively affects the health of those near and downwind of the power plant, and generation costs often do not reflect these external costs. A comparison of the \"real\" cost of various energy sources is complicated by a number of uncertainties: Lazard's report on the estimated levelized cost of energy by source (10th edition) estimated unsubsidized prices of $97–$136/MWh for nuclear, $50–$60/MWh for solar PV, $32–$62/MWh for onshore wind, and $82–$155/MWh for offshore wind. [83] However, the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry do not involve cash payments. Rather, they shift construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and nuclear waste management. This approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industry's history, and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments. [84] Benjamin K. Sovacool said in 2011 that: \"When the full nuclear fuel cycle is considered — not only reactors but also uranium mines and mills, enrichment facilities, spent fuel repositories, and decommissioning sites — nuclear power proves to be one of the costliest sources of energy\". [85] Brookings Institution published The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies in 2014 which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that \"The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants\", with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power. [86] [87] Moreover, Paul Joskow of MIT maintains that the \" Levelized cost of electricity \" (LCOE) metric is a poor means of comparing electricity sources as it hides the extra costs, such as the need to frequently operate back up power stations, incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind energy, while the value of baseload power sources are underpresented. [88] Kristin Shrader-Frechette analysed 30 papers on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest. She found of the 30, 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear, 11 were funded by universities or non-profit non-government organisations and were anti-nuclear, the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance. The pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsidies and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible. The situation was compared to medical research where 98% of industry sponsored studies return positive results. [89]",

Although wind power forecasts have been used operationally for decades, as of 2019 [update] the IEA is organizing international collaboration to further improve their accuracy. [19] Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics, among other factors. If wind speed is too low then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage.  While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable. [10] Because wind power is generated by large numbers of small generators, individual failures do not have large impacts on power grids. This feature of wind has been referred to as resiliency.

Solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons, and is affected by dust, fog, cloud cover, frost or snow.  Many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day. [37] The impact of intermittency of solar-generated electricity will depend on the correlation of generation with demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power. [42] [43] [44]",

The availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid.  Typical round trip efficiency is 80%. [10] [70] Traditional lithium-ion is the most common type used for grid-scale battery storage as of 2020 [update] . [71] Rechargeable flow batteries can serve as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium. [13] Hydrogen can be created through electrolysis and stored for later use. [72] Flywheel energy storage systems have some advantages over chemical batteries. Along with substantial durability which allows them to be cycled frequently without noticeable life reduction, they also have very fast response and ramp rates. They can go from full discharge to full charge within a few seconds. [73] They can be manufactured using non-toxic and environmentally friendly materials, easily recyclable once the service life is over. [74] Thermal energy storage stores heat. Stored heat can be used directly for heating needs or converted into electricity. In the context of a CHP plant a heat storage can serve as a functional electricity storage at comparably low costs. Ice storage air conditioning Ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand. Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed. Storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient.

        "text": "The variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines, for example, in a wind farm, results in lower statistical variation, as long as the correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system. [75] Multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations. Wind output can be predicted with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts, especially from large numbers of turbines/farms. The ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected, especially from newer facilities. [75] Electricity produced from solar energy tends to counterbalance the fluctuating supplies generated from wind.  Normally it is windiest at night and during cloudy or stormy weather, and there is more sunshine on clear days with less wind. [76] Besides, wind energy has often a peak in the winter season, whereas solar energy has a peak in the summer season; the combination of wind and solar reduces the need for dispatchable backup power.

        "text": "In countries with a considerable amount of renewable energy, solar energy causes price drops around noon every day. PV production follows the higher demand during these hours. The images below show two weeks in 2022 in Germany, where renewable energy has a share of over 40%. [107] Prices also drop every night and weekend due to low demand. In hours without PV and wind power, electricity prices rise. This can lead to demand side adjustments. While industry is dependent on the hourly prices, most private households still pay a fixed tariff. With smart meters , private consomers can also be motivated i.e. to load an electric car when enough renewable energy is available and prices are cheap. Steerable flexibility in electricity production is essential to back up variable energy sources. The German example shows that pumped hydro storage, gas plants and hard coal jump in fast. Lignite varies on a daily basis. Nuclear power and biomass can theoretically adjust to a certain extent. However, in this case incentives still seem not be high enough.",
