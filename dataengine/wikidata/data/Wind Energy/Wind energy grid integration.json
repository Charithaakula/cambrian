        "text": "Wind is air movement in the Earth's atmosphere. In a unit of time, say 1 second, the volume of air that had passed an area A {\\displaystyle A} is A v {\\displaystyle Av} . If the air density is ρ {\\displaystyle \\rho } , the mass of this volume of air is M = ρ A v {\\displaystyle M=\\rho Av} , and the power transfer, or energy transfer per second is P = 1 2 M v 2 = 1 2 ρ A v 3 {\\displaystyle P={\\tfrac {1}{2}}Mv^{2}={\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\rho Av^{3}} . Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Change of wind speed by a factor of 2.1544 increases the wind power by one order of magnitude (multiply by 10). The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m 2 over the period from 1979 to 2010, 1.31 MJ/m 2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m 2 in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m 2 thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction. [15] Through wind resource assessment , it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential. [13] [16] [17] Unlike 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution. [18] More detailed, site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities. The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. [19] The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there. To assess prospective wind power sites, a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data. [20] Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model. [21]",

        "text": "Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation. Wind power's share of worldwide electricity usage in 2021 was almost 7%, [55] up from 3.5% in 2015. [56] [57] There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage , demand management, and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. [58] These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability. [59] A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually. To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems, for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid . [60] On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored, exported or curtailed. The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include the production of silicon, aluminum, [61] steel, or natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long-term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy . [62] [63] [ better source needed ] Homes and businesses can also be programmed to vary electricity demand , [64] [65] for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats. [66]",

        "section": "Variability",
        "text": "Wind power is variable, and during low wind periods, it may need to be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time. Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists but is not as significant. [ citation needed ] Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non- dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve , and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management , load shedding , storage solutions, or system interconnection with HVDC cables. Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation, [67] [68] but car batteries may gain ground from the mid-2020s. [69] Wind power advocates argue that periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. [70] The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world. [71] Solar power tends to be complementary to wind. [73] [74] On daily to weekly timescales, high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. [A] [75] Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. [72] Wind hybrid power systems are becoming more popular. [76]",

Falling prices continue to drive the Levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%. [88] [ needs update ] In 2021, the CEO of Siemens Gamesa warned that increased demand for low-cost wind turbines combined with high input costs and high costs of steel result in increased pressure on the manufacturers and decreasing profit margins.

        "text": "Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs. [91] The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources. [92] However, the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including the cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be more than 20 years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidized, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimizing the use of expensive peaking power plants . [93] The cost has decreased as wind turbine technology has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance, and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital expenditure costs and maintenance costs have continued to decline. [94] In 2021, a Lazard study of unsubsidized electricity said that wind power levelized cost of electricity continues to fall but more slowly than before. The study estimated new wind-generated electricity cost from $26 to $50/MWh, compared to new gas power from $45 to $74/MWh. The median cost of fully deprecated existing coal power was $42/MWh, nuclear $29/MWh and gas $24/MWh. The study estimated offshore wind at around $83/MWh. Compound annual growth rate was 4% per year from 2016 to 2021, compared to 10% per year from 2009 to 2021. [10]",

[102] Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint . Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas. [103] Examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City , where, since 2009, several building projects have capped their roofs with Gorlov-type helical wind turbines . Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings' overall consumption, they help to reinforce the building's 'green' credentials in ways that \"showing people your high-tech boiler\" cannot, with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority . [104] Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs. [105] Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, photovoltaic , or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. [106] Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.

        "text": "The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power . [110] Wind turbines have some of the lowest life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources : far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity, so wind power helps limit climate change. [111] Use of engineered wood may allow carbon negative wind power. [112] Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no local air pollution , unlike fossil fuel power sources. Onshore wind farms can have a significant visual impact. [113] Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements, wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations. [7] [114] Their network of turbines, access roads, transmission lines, and substations can result in \"energy sprawl\"; [8] although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture. [115] [116] Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas, archaeological landscapes and heritage sites. [117] [118] [119] A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views. [120] Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms, [8] but the worldwide ecological impact is minimal. [110] Thousands of birds and bats, including rare species, have been killed by wind turbine blades, [121] though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations. [122] This can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring. [123] Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass , and have a lifetime of 20 years. [124] Blades are hollow: some blades are crushed to reduce their volume and then landfilled. [125] However, as they can take a lot of weight they can be made into long lasting small bridges for walkers or cyclists. [126] Blade end-of-life is complicated, [127] and blades manufactured in the 2020s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable. [128] Wind turbines also generate noise. At a distance of 300 metres (980 ft), this may be around 45 dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At 1.5 km (1 mi), they become inaudible. [129] [130] There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines. [131] Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.

[146] Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation, onshore or near offshore wind farms are sometimes opposed for their impact on the landscape (especially scenic areas, heritage areas and archaeological landscapes), as well as noise, and impact on tourism.

[143] [144] [150] Public support in the United States has decreased from 75% in 2020 to 62% in 2021, with the Democrat Party supporting the use of wind energy twice as much as the Republican Party. [151] President Biden has signed an executive order to begin building large scale wind farms. [152] In China , Shen et al. (2019) found that Chinese city-dwellers may be resistant to building wind turbines in urban areas, with a surprisingly high proportion of people citing an unfounded fear of radiation as driving their concerns. [153] Also, the study finds that like their counterparts in OECD countries, urban Chinese respondents are sensitive to direct costs and wildlife externalities. Distributing relevant information about turbines to the public may alleviate resistance.",

[156] [157] [158] In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects . Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks. [143] [159] [160] Some may still object to wind farms [161] but many say their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by air pollution , [162] [111] climate change [163] and the opinions of the broader community. [164] In the US, wind power projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads, and hospitals, and to revitalize the economies of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners. [98] In the UK, both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms. [165] [166] Some wind farms have become tourist attractions. The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room, a learning hub, a café with a viewing deck and also a shop. It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre . [167] In Denmark, a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine. The loss must be at least 1% of the property's value. [168] Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large, local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. [169] [170] [171] As well as concerns about the landscape, there are concerns that some installations can produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. [172] A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected. [173] While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity, protest groups are often formed to attempt to block some wind power stations for various reasons. [161] [174] [175] Some opposition to wind farms is dismissed as NIMBYism , [176] but research carried out in 2009 found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to wind farms because of a \"Not in my Back Yard\" attitude.

        "text": "The two most important forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, are intermittent energy sources : they are not available constantly, resulting in lower capacity factors . In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time. Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions. Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month. [31] This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide. [32] Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages . In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby [33] [34] until there is enough energy storage, demand response , grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources. In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency. [35] Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand. [36] Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid . [37] Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, [38] and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling. [39] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather. In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity. [40]",

[52] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions , geographic location and time of day. [53] There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal , which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity. [12] PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022. [54] It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, [55] compared to 25 GW of solar thermal. [54] Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building. Examples include solar chimneys , [12] orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . [56] From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments. China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013. Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19 , growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines. Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.

Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines. [12] Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [76] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [77] Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines. [78] Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe. Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. [57]",

[68] Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed. [87] [88] New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land. [89] High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments. [90] It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid. [91] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power. Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE [92] [93] countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.

Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy. [99] The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark. [100] Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production. In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. [101] In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO 2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels). [102]",

[104] Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights. [105] Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel . [12] Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize , while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil . [106] Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, [107] although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015. [106] The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region. Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil. [108] In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks. [109] China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat. [110] In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures . [101] There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales. For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today. [111] Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates. [112] Cow dung can be converted into methane. [113] There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel , which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.

It originates from several different sources , of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior , [12] as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth . [119] Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core . [119] Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed. [120] As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, [121] or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity [122] ), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW. [121] Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity. At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps , which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters. [120] Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F). In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%). [123] Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available. For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water. In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth. [120]",

This is an 85% acceleration from the previous five years, and almost 30% higher than what the IEA forecast in its 2021 report, making its largest ever upward revision. Renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period. [68] To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, IEA believes that 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources. [17] In June 2022 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to \"ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.\" [185] China's five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal. [186] REPowerEU , the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas , is expected to call for much more green hydrogen . [187] After a transitional period, [188] renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world's energy production.

        "text": "Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion. Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy. [199] The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA. [200] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states. [201] The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, [202] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. [203] The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [204] In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy. [199] National targets that year existed in 176 countries. [204] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels. [104] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades . Many national, state and local governments have created green banks . A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [205] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal . [206] For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\" [207]",

        "text": "The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research. [219] Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Norway , are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth. Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical \"losers\" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy. Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets . [220] It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels. [221] Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence. [222] [223] In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels , wind turbines , and lithium-ion batteries . [224] Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [225] Some may produce and export green hydrogen , [226] [225] although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015). [227] Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy. The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains. [228] Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest. Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola , Chad , Gabon , and Sudan , all countries with a history of military coups , to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income. [229] A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [230] In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" [231] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests.\" [231] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. [232] [233] [234] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports . According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.\" [235]",

[260] [261] [262] Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms.

It is sometimes also referred to as a mega grid . Super grids can support a global energy transition by smoothing local fluctuations of wind energy and solar energy . In this context they are considered as a key technology to mitigate global warming . Super grids typically use High-voltage direct current (HVDC) to transmit electricity long distances. The latest generation of HVDC power lines can transmit energy with losses of only 1.6% per 1000 km. [19] Electric utilities between regions are many times interconnected for improved economy and reliability. Electrical interconnectors allow for economies of scale, allowing energy to be purchased from large, efficient sources. Utilities can draw power from generator reserves from a different region to ensure continuing, reliable power and diversify their loads. Interconnection also allows regions to have access to cheap bulk energy by receiving power from different sources. For example, one region may be producing cheap hydro power during high water seasons, but in low water seasons, another area may be producing cheaper power through wind, allowing both regions to access cheaper energy sources from one another during different times of the year. Neighboring utilities also help others to maintain the overall system frequency and also help manage tie transfers between utility regions. [20] Electricity Interconnection Level (EIL) of a grid is the ratio of the total interconnector power to the grid divided by the installed production capacity of the grid. Within the EU, it has set a target of national grids reaching 10% by 2020, and 15% by 2030. [21]",

This networked system of connections is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers. Because the power is often generated far from where it is consumed, the transmission system can cover great distances. For a given amount of power, transmission efficiency is greater at higher voltages and lower currents. Therefore, voltages are stepped up at the generating station, and stepped down at local substations for distribution to customers. Most transmission is three-phase . Three phase, compared to single phase, can deliver much more power for a given amount of wire, since the neutral and ground wires are shared. [22] Further, three-phase generators and motors are more efficient than their single-phase counterparts. However, for conventional conductors one of the main losses are resistive losses which are a square law on current, and depend on distance. High voltage AC transmission lines can lose 1-4% per hundred miles. [23] However, high-voltage direct current can have half the losses of AC. Over very long distances, these efficiencies can offset the additional cost of the required AC/DC converter stations at each end. Transmission networks are complex with redundant pathways. The physical layout is often forced by what land is available and its geology. Most transmission grids offer the reliability that more complex mesh networks provide. Redundancy allows line failures to occur and power is simply rerouted while repairs are done.",

As of 2020 [update] , the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity , with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage hydroelectricity . Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand, and for use when production unexpectedly falls giving time for slower responding resources to be brought online. Two alternatives to grid storage are the use of peaking power plants to fill in supply gaps and demand response to shift load to other times.",

        "text": "A black start is the process of restoring an electric power station or a part of an electric grid to operation without relying on the external electric power transmission network to recover from a total or partial shutdown. [35] Normally, the electric power used within the plant is provided from the station's own generators. If all of the plant's main generators are shut down, station service power is provided by drawing power from the grid through the plant's transmission line. However, during a wide-area outage, off-site power from the grid is not available. In the absence of grid power, a so-called black start needs to be performed to bootstrap the power grid into operation. To provide a black start, some power stations have small diesel generators , normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), which can be used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps , boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants. [36] In 2017 a utility in Southern California has successfully demonstrated the use of a battery energy storage system to provide a black start, firing up a combined cycle gas turbine from an idle state.

The centrifugal force on the blades increases as the square of the rotation speed, which makes this structure sensitive to overspeed. Because power increases as the cube of the wind speed, turbines have must survive much higher wind loads (such as gusts of wind) than those loads from which they generate power. A wind turbine must produce power over a range of wind speeds. The cut-in speed is around 3–4 m/s for most turbines, and cut-out at 25 m/s. [2] If the rated wind speed is exceeded the power has to be limited. A control system involves three basic elements: sensors to measure process variables, actuators to manipulate energy capture and component loading, and control algorithms that apply information gathered by the sensors to coordinate the actuators. [3] Any wind blowing above the survival speed damages the turbine. The survival speed of commercial wind turbines ranges from 40 m/s (144 km/h, 89 MPH) to 72 m/s (259 km/h, 161 MPH), typically around 60 m/s (216 km/h, 134 MPH).

        "section": "Furling",
        "text": "Furling works by decreasing the angle of attack, which reduces drag and blade cross-section. One major problem is getting the blades to stall or furl quickly enough in a wind gust. A fully furled turbine blade, when stopped, faces the edge of the blade into the wind. Loads can be reduced by making a structural system softer or more flexible. [3] This can be accomplished with downwind rotors or with curved blades that twist naturally to reduce angle of attack at higher wind speeds. These systems are nonlinear and couple the structure to the flow field - requiring design tools to evolve to model these nonlinearities. Standard turbines all furl in high winds. Since furling requires acting against the torque on the blade, it requires some form of pitch angle control, which is achieved with a slewing drive . This drive precisely angles the blade while withstanding high torque loads. In addition, many turbines use hydraulic systems. These systems are usually spring-loaded, so that if hydraulic power fails, the blades automatically furl. Other turbines use an electric servomotor for every blade. They have a battery-reserve in case of grid failure. Small wind turbines (under 50 kW) with variable- pitching generally use systems operated by centrifugal force, either by flyweights or geometric design, and avoid electric or hydraulic controls. Fundamental gaps exist in pitch control, limiting the reduction of energy costs, according to a report funded by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future . Load reduction is currently focused on full-span blade pitch control, since individual pitch motors are the actuators on commercial turbines. Significant load mitigation has been demonstrated in simulations for blades, tower, and drive train. However, further research is needed to increase energy capture and mitigate fatigue loads. A control technique applied to the pitch angle is done by comparing the power output with the power value at the rated engine speed (power reference, Ps reference). Pitch control is done with PI controller. In order to adjust pitch rapidly enough, the actuator uses the time constant Tservo, an integrator and limiters. The pitch angle remains from 0° to 30° with a change rate  of 10°/second. As in the figure at the right, the reference pitch angle is compared with the actual pitch angle b and then the difference is corrected by the actuator. The reference pitch angle, which comes from the PI controller, goes through a limiter. Restrictions are important to maintain the pitch angle in real terms. Limiting the change rate is especially important during network faults. The importance is due to the fact that the controller decides how quickly it can reduce the aerodynamic energy to avoid acceleration during errors. [3]",

This is a common control strategy because only the Iqs current must be controlled. The torque equation of the generator is a linear equation dependent only on the Iqs current. So, the electromagnetic torque for Ids = 0 (we can achieve that with the d-axis controller) is now: T e = 3 / 2 p ( λ p m I q s + ( L d s − L q s ) I d s I q s ) = 3 / 2 p λ p m I q s {\\displaystyle Te=3/2p(\\lambda pmIqs+(Lds-Lqs)IdsIqs)=3/2p\\lambda pmIqs} Thus, the complete system of the machine side converter and the cascaded PI controller loops is given by the figure.

Older wind turbines generate electricity through asynchronous machines directly connected to the grid. The gearbox reduces generator cost and weight. Commercial generators have a rotor carrying a winding so that a rotating magnetic field is produced inside a set of windings called the stator . While the rotating winding consumes a fraction of a percent of the generator output, adjustment of the field current allows good control over the output voltage. The rotor's varying output frequency and voltage can be matched to the fixed values of the grid using multiple technologies such as doubly fed induction generators or full-effect converters, which converts the variable frequency current to DC and then back to AC using inverters . Although such alternatives require costly equipment and cost power, the turbine can capture a significantly larger fraction of the wind energy. Most are low -voltage 660 Volt, but some offshore turbines (several MW) are 3.3 kV medium voltage . [15] In some cases, especially when offshore, a large collector transformer converts the wind farm's medium-voltage AC grid to DC and transmits the energy through a power cable to an onshore HVDC converter station .",

Wind turbines spin at varying speeds (a consequence of their generator design). Use of aluminum and composite materials has contributed to low rotational inertia , which means that newer wind turbines can accelerate quickly if the winds pick up, keeping the tip speed ratio more nearly constant. Operating closer to their optimal tip speed ratio during energetic gusts of wind allows wind turbines to improve energy capture from sudden gusts. Noise increases with tip speed. To increase tip speed without increasing noise would reduce torque into the gearbox and generator, reducing structural loads, thereby reducing cost. [3] The noise reduction is linked to the detailed blade aerodynamics, especially factors that reduce abrupt stalling. The inability to predict stall restricts the use of aggressive aerodynamics. [3] Some blades (mostly on Enercon ) have a winglet to increase performance and reduce noise.

        "text": "The number of blades is selected for aerodynamic efficiency, component costs, and system reliability. Noise emissions are affected by the location of the blades upwind or downwind of the tower and the rotor speed. Given that the noise emissions from the blades' trailing edges and tips vary by the 5th power of blade speed, a small increase in tip speed dramatically increases noise. Wind turbines almost universally use either two or three blades. However, patents present designs with additional blades, such as Chan Shin's multi-unit rotor blade system. [30] Aerodynamic efficiency increases with number of blades but with diminishing return. Increasing from one to two yields a six percent increase, while going from two to three yields an additional three percent. [31] Further increasing the blade count yields minimal improvements and sacrifices too much in blade stiffness as the blades become thinner. [ citation needed ] Theoretically, an infinite number of blades of zero width is the most efficient, operating at a high value of the tip speed ratio, but this is not practical. [32] Component costs affected by blade count are primarily for materials and manufacturing of the turbine rotor and drive train. [33] Generally, the lower the number of blades, the lower the material and manufacturing costs. In addition, fewer blades allow higher rotational speed. Blade stiffness requirements to avoid tower interference limit blade thickness, but only when the blades are upwind of the tower; deflection in a downwind machine increases tower clearance. Fewer blades with higher rotational speeds reduce peak torque in the drive train, resulting in lower gearbox and generator costs. System reliability is affected by blade count primarily through the dynamic loading of the rotor into the drive train and tower systems. While aligning the wind turbine to changes in wind direction (yawing), each blade experiences a cyclic load at its root end depending on blade position. However, these cyclic loads when combined at the drive train shaft are symmetrically balanced for three blades, yielding smoother operation during yaw. One or two blade turbines can use a pivoting teetered hub to nearly eliminate the cyclic loads into the drive shaft and system during yawing. In 2012, a Chinese 3.6 MW two-blade turbine was tested in Denmark. [34] Aesthetics are a factor in that the three-bladed rotor rates more pleasing to look at than a one- or two-bladed rotor.

        "text": "In general, materials should meet the following criteria: Metals are undesirable because of their vulnerability to fatigue. Ceramics have low fracture toughness, resulting in early blade failure. Traditional polymers are not stiff enough to be useful, and wood has problems with repeatability, especially considering the blade length. That leaves fiber-reinforced composites, which have high strength and stiffness and low density. [ citation needed ] Wood and canvas sails were used on early windmills due to their low price, availability, and ease of manufacture. Smaller blades can be made from light metals such as aluminium . These materials, however, require frequent maintenance. Wood and canvas construction limits the airfoil shape to a flat plate, which has a relatively high ratio of drag to force captured(low aerodynamic efficiency) compared to solid airfoils. Construction of solid airfoil designs requires inflexible materials such as metals or composites . Some blades incorporate lightning conductors. Increasing blade length pushed power generation from the single megawatt range to upwards of 10 megawatts. A larger area effectively increases tip-speed ratio at a given wind speed, thus increasing its energy extraction. [36] Software such as HyperSizer (originally developed for spacecraft design) can be used to improve blade design. [37] [38] As of 2015 the rotor diameters of onshore wind turbine blades reached 130 meters, [39] while the diameter of offshore turbines reached 170 meters. [40] In 2001, an estimated 50 million kilograms of fiberglass laminate were used in wind turbine blades. [41] An important goal is to control blade weight. Since blade mass scales as the cube of the turbine radius, gravity loading constrains systems with larger blades. [42] Gravitational loads include axial and tensile/ compressive loads (top/bottom of rotation) as well as bending (lateral positions). The magnitude of these loads fluctuates cyclically and the edgewise moments (see below) are reversed every 180° of rotation. Typical rotor speeds and design life are ~10 and 20 years, respectively, with the number of lifetime revolutions on the order of 10^8. Considering wind, it is expected that turbine blades go through ~10^9 loading cycles. Wind is another source of rotor blade loading. Lift causes bending in the flatwise direction (out of rotor plane) while airflow around the blade cause edgewise bending (in the rotor plane). Flaps bending involves tension on the pressure (upwind) side and compression on the suction (downwind) side. Edgewise bending involves tension on the leading edge and compression on the trailing edge. Wind loads are cyclical because of natural variability in wind speed and wind shear (higher speeds at top of rotation). Failure in ultimate loading of wind-turbine rotor blades exposed to wind and gravity loading is a failure mode that needs to be considered when the rotor blades are designed. The wind speed that causes bending of the rotor blades exhibits a natural variability, and so does the stress response in the rotor blades. Also, the resistance of the rotor blades, in terms of their tensile strengths, exhibits a natural variability. [43] Given the increasing size of production wind turbines, blade failures are increasingly relevant when assessing public safety risks from wind turbines. The most common failure is the loss of a blade or part thereof. [44] This has to be considered in the design. In light of these failure modes and increasingly larger blade systems, researchers seek cost-effective materials with higher strength-to-mass ratios. [35]",

The long fibers provide longitudinal stiffness and strength, and the matrix provides fracture toughness, delamination strength, out-of-plane strength, and stiffness. [35] Material indices based on maximizing power efficiency, high fracture toughness, fatigue resistance, and thermal stability are highest for glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (GFRPs and CFRPs). [45] In turbine blades, matrices such as thermosets or thermoplastics are used; as of 2017, thermosets are more common. [46] These allow for the fibers to be bound together and add toughness. Thermosets make up 80% of the market [ when? ] , as they have lower viscosity, and also allow for low temperature cure, both features contributing to ease of processing during manufacture. Thermoplastics offer recyclability that the thermosets do not, however their processing temperature and viscosity are much higher, limiting the product size and consistency, which are both important for large blades. Fracture toughness is higher for thermoplastics, but the fatigue behavior is worse. [47] Manufacturing blades in the 40 to 50-metre range involves proven fiberglass composite fabrication techniques. Manufacturers such as Nordex SE and GE Wind use an infusion process. Other manufacturers vary this technique, some including carbon and wood with fiberglass in an epoxy matrix. Other options include pre-impregnated (\"prepreg\") fiberglass and vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding. Each of these options uses a glass-fiber reinforced polymer composite constructed with differing complexity. Perhaps the largest issue with open-mould, wet systems is the emissions associated with the volatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\") released. Preimpregnated materials and resin infusion techniques contain all VOCs, however these contained processes have their challenges, because the production of thick laminates necessary for structural components becomes more difficult. In particular, the preform resin permeability dictates the maximum laminate thickness; also, bleeding is required to eliminate voids and ensure proper resin distribution. [41] One solution to resin distribution is to use partially impregnated fiberglass. During evacuation, the dry fabric provides a path for airflow and, once heat and pressure are applied, the resin may flow into the dry region, resulting in an evenly impregnated laminate structure.

        "text": "Wind velocities increase at higher altitudes due to surface aerodynamic drag (by land or water surfaces) and air viscosity. The variation in velocity with altitude, called wind shear , is most dramatic near the surface. Typically, the variation follows the wind profile power law , which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10% and the expected power by 34%. To avoid buckling , doubling the tower height generally requires doubling the tower diameter, increasing the amount of material by a factor of at least four. During the night, or when the atmosphere becomes stable, wind speed close to the ground usually subsides whereas at turbine hub altitude it does not decrease that much or may even increase. As a result, the wind speed is higher and a turbine will produce more power than expected from the 1/7 power law: doubling the altitude may increase wind speed by 20% to 60%. A stable atmosphere is caused by radiative cooling of the surface and is common in a temperate climate: it usually occurs when there is a (partly) clear sky at night. When the (high altitude) wind is strong (a 10-meter wind speed higher than approximately 6 to 7 m/s) the stable atmosphere is disrupted because of friction turbulence and the atmosphere turns neutral. A daytime atmosphere is either neutral (no net radiation; usually with strong winds and heavy clouding) or unstable (rising air because of ground heating—by the sun). The 1/7 power law is a good approximation of the wind profile. Indiana was rated as having a wind capacity of 30,000 MW, but by raising the expected turbine height from 50 m to 70 m raised the wind capacity to 40,000 MW, and could be double that at 100 m. [70] For HAWTs, tower heights approximately two to three times the blade length balance material costs of the tower against better utilisation of the more expensive active components. Road restrictions make tower transport with a diameter of more than 4.3 m difficult. Swedish analyses showed that the bottom wing tip must be at least 30 m above the tree tops. [71] A 3 MW turbine may increase output from 5,000 MWh to 7,700 MWh per year by rising from 80 to 125 meters. [72] A tower profile made of connected shells rather than cylinders can have a larger diameter and still be transportable. A 100 m prototype tower with TC bolted 18 mm 'plank' shells  at the wind turbine test center Høvsøre in Denmark was certified by Det Norske Veritas , with a Siemens nacelle. Shell elements can be shipped in standard 12 m shipping containers . [71] [73] [74] As of 2003, typical modern wind turbine installations used 65 metres (213 ft) towers. Height is typically limited by the availability of cranes . This led to proposals for \"partially self-erecting wind turbines\" that, for a given available crane, allow taller towers that locate a turbine in stronger and steadier winds, and \"self-erecting wind turbines\" that could be installed without cranes.

        "text": "Grid-connected wind turbines, until the 1970s, were fixed-speed. As recently as 2003, nearly all grid-connected wind turbines operated at constant speed (synchronous generators) or within a few percent of constant speed (induction generators). [88] [89] As of 2011, many turbines used fixed-speed induction generators (FSIG). [90] By then, most newly connected turbines were variable speed . [90] Early control systems were designed for peak power extraction, also called maximum power point tracking —they attempted to pull the maximum power from a given wind turbine under the current wind conditions. [ citation needed ] More recent systems deliberately pull less than maximum power in most circumstances, in order to provide other benefits, which include: The generator produces alternating current (AC). The most common method in large modern turbines is to use a doubly fed induction generator directly connected to the grid. Some turbines drive an AC/AC converter —which converts the AC to direct current (DC) with a rectifier and then back to AC with an inverter —in order to match grid frequency and phase. A useful technique to connect a PMSG to the grid is via a back-to-back converter. Control schemes can achieve unity power factor in the connection to the grid. In that way the wind turbine does not consume reactive power, which is the most common problem with turbines that use induction machines. This leads to a more stable power system. Moreover, with different control schemes a PMSG turbine can provide or consume reactive power. So, it can work as a dynamic capacitor / inductor bank to help with grid stability. The diagram shows the control scheme for a unity power factor : Reactive power regulation consists of one PI controller in order to achieve operation with unity power factor (i.e. Q grid = 0 ). I dN has to be regulated to reach zero at steady-state (I dNref = 0). The complete system of the grid side converter and the cascaded PI controller loops is displayed in the figure.",

        "text": "Wind turbines, by their nature, are very tall, slender structures, [97] and this can cause a number of issues when the structural design of the foundations are considered. The foundations for a conventional engineering structure are designed mainly to transfer the vertical load (dead weight) to the ground, generally allowing comparatively unsophisticated arrangement to be used. However, in the case of wind turbines, the force of the wind's interaction with the rotor at the top of the tower creates a strong tendency to tip the wind turbine over. This loading regime causes large moment loads to be applied to the foundations of a wind turbine. As a result, considerable attention needs to be given when designing the footings to ensure that the foundation will resist this tipping tendency. [98] One of the most common foundations for offshore wind turbines is the monopile , a single large-diameter (4 to 6 metres) tubular steel pile driven to a depth of 5-6 times the diameter of the pile into the seabed. The cohesion of the soil, and friction between the pile and the soil provide the necessary structural support for the wind turbine. [99] In onshore turbines the most common type of foundation is a gravity foundation, where a large mass of concrete spread out over a large area is used to resist the turbine loads. Wind turbine size & type, wind conditions and soil conditions at the site are all determining factors in the design of the foundation. [100] Prestressed piles or rock anchors are alternative foundation designs that use much less concrete and steel. [101]",

Technological limitations on metering no longer force peak power prices to be averaged out and passed on to all consumers equally. In parallel, growing concerns over environmental damage from fossil-fired power stations have led to a desire to use large amounts of renewable energy . Dominant forms such as wind power and solar power are highly variable, and so the need for more sophisticated control systems became apparent, to facilitate the connection of sources to the otherwise highly controllable grid. [11] Power from photovoltaic cells (and to lesser extent wind turbines ) has also, significantly, called into question the imperative for large, centralised power stations. The rapidly falling costs point to a major change from the centralised grid topology to one that is highly distributed, with power being both generated and consumed right at the limits of the grid. Finally, growing concern over terrorist attacks in some countries has led to calls for a more robust energy grid that is less dependent on centralised power stations that were perceived to be potential attack targets.

It also gives utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices directly in order to prevent system overloads. Examples would be a utility reducing the usage of a group of electric vehicle charging stations or shifting temperature set points of air conditioners in a city. [28] To motivate them to cut back use and perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling , prices of electricity are increased during high demand periods and decreased during low demand periods. [11] It is thought that consumers and businesses will tend to consume less during high-demand periods if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices to be aware of the high price premium for using electricity at peak periods. This could mean making trade-offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm. When businesses and consumers see a direct economic benefit of using energy at off-peak times, the theory is that they will include the energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions and hence become more energy efficient.",

A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.’’ [10] The Berkeley Lab defines: \"A microgrid consists of energy generation and energy storage that can power a building, campus, or community when not connected to the electric grid, e.g. in the event of a disaster.\" A microgrid that can be disconnected from the utility grid (at the 'point of common coupling' or PCC) is called an 'islandable microgrid'. [7] An EU research project [11] describes a microgrid as comprising Low-Voltage (LV) distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) ( microturbines , fuel cells , photovoltaics (PV), etc.), storage devices ( batteries , flywheels ) energy storage system and flexible loads. Such systems can operate either connected or disconnected from the main grid. The operation of microsources in the network can provide benefits to the overall system performance, if managed and coordinated efficiently. [ citation needed ] Electropedia defines a microgrid as a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources with defined electrical boundaries, which form a local electric power system at distribution voltage levels, meaning both low and medium voltage up to 35 kV. This cluster of associated consumer and producer nodes acts as a single controllable entity and is able to operate in either grid-connected or island mode . [3] A stand-alone microgrid or isolated microgrid, sometimes called an \"island grid\", only operates off-the-grid and cannot be connected to a wider electric power system. They are usually designed for geographical islands or for rural electrification. [4] In many non-industrialized countries, microgrids that are used to provide access to electricity in previously unelectrified areas are often referred to as \" mini grids \".

        "text": "The faster the average wind speed, the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are generally economically better for wind farm developments. [7] The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise there is a risk of damage. The average power in the wind is not proportional to the average wind speed. For this reason, the ideal wind conditions would be strong but consistent winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction. Mountain passes are ideal locations for wind farms under these conditions. Mountain passes channel wind, blocked by mountains, through a tunnel like pass towards areas of lower pressure and flatter land. [8] Passes used for wind farms like the San Gorgonio Pass and Altamont Pass are known for their abundant wind resource capacity and capability for large-scale wind farms. These types of passes were the first places in the 1980s to have heavily invested large-scale wind farms after approval for wind energy development by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. From these wind farms, developers learned much about turbulence and crowding effects of large-scale wind projects, which were previously unresearched, in the U.S. due to the lack of operational wind farms large enough to conduct these types of studies. [9] Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas , and validated with on-site wind measurements via long term or permanent meteorological-tower data using anemometers and wind vanes . Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential [10] [11] in order to finance the project. [12] Local winds are often monitored for a year or more, detailed wind maps are constructed, along with rigorous grid capability studies conducted, before any wind generators are installed. The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. At altitudes of thousands of feet/hundreds of metres above sea level, the power in the wind decreases proportional to the decrease in air density. [13]",

ATC is the measure of the remaining capacity in a transmission system available for further integration of two interconnected areas without significant upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations. Significant equipment upgrades have substantial costs, potentially undermining the viability of a project within a location, regardless of wind resource availability. [14] Once a list of capable areas is constructed, the list is refined based on long term wind measurements, among other environmental or technical limiting factors such as proximity to load and land procurement. Many independent system operators (ISOs) in the United States such as the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO use interconnection request queues to allow developers to propose a new generation for a specific given area and grid interconnection. [15] These request queues have both deposit costs at the time of request and ongoing costs for the studies the ISO will make for up to years after the request was submitted to ascertain the viability of the interconnection due to factors such as ATC. [16] Larger corporations who can afford to bid the most queues will most likely have market power as to which sites with the most resource and opportunity are eventually developed. After the deadline to request a place in the queue has passed, many firms will withdraw their requests after gauging the competition in order to make back some of the deposit for each request that is determined too risky in comparison to other larger firms' requests.",

The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30 metres could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.",

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. Capacity factors (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations. [39] The province of Ontario, Canada is pursuing several proposed locations in the Great Lakes , including the suspended [40] Trillium Power Wind 1 approximately 20 km from shore and over 400 MW in size. [41] Other Canadian projects include one on the Pacific west coast. [42] In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast; [38] and in late 2016 the Block Island Wind Farm was commissioned. Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. As of 2015 [update] , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5 MW. [44] Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. [ citation needed ] Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.",

[74] [75] [76] However, the rapid growth outpaced China's infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012. [77] At the end of 2009, wind power in China accounted for 25.1 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity, [78] and China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy. [79] With its large land mass and long coastline, China has exceptional wind resources. [80] Researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua University have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030. [81] By the end of 2008, at least 15 Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components. [82] Turbine sizes of 1.5 MW to 3 MW became common. Leading wind power companies in China were Goldwind , Dongfang Electric , and Sinovel [83] along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers. [84] China also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines (80 MW) in 2008. Through all these developments, the Chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008 , according to industry observers. [83] According to the Global Wind Energy Council , the development of wind energy in China, in terms of scale and rhythm, is unparalleled in the world. The National People's Congress permanent committee passed a law that requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector. [85]",

Germany had the third-largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States), with an installed capacity of 29,060 MW at the end of 2011. Spain had 21,674 MW, and Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW. [86] [87] By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW. [88] But energy production can be different from capacity – in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh compared to Germany's 35 TWh. [89] In addition to the ' London Array ', an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom , with a capacity of 630 MW (the world's largest off-shore wind farm when built), other large wind farms in Europe include Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm near Constanța , Romania with 600 MW capacity, [90] [91] and Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow , Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW. An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of dispatchable generation capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a \" supergrid \" to connect national grids together [92] across western Europe , ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world. [93] The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will tend to be blowing somewhere. In July 2022, Seagreen , the world's deepest fixed-bottom wind farm, became operative. Located 26 miles off the Angus coastline, in Scotland, it has 114 turbines that generate 1.1 gigawatts (GW) of electricity. [94] [95]",

The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of the project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW. Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has built a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex is a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW was expected to be completed. The Pakistani government also issued a Letter Of Interest in a 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. The Pakistani government had plans to achieve electric power  generation of up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down an energy shortage. Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Limited 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Limited 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Limited 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy) and were expected to achieve COD in 2017. In the Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 & II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Limited 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt. Limited 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017. According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.",

Although wind power forecasts have been used operationally for decades, as of 2019 [update] the IEA is organizing international collaboration to further improve their accuracy. [19] Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics, among other factors. If wind speed is too low then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage.  While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable.

Many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day. [37] The impact of intermittency of solar-generated electricity will depend on the correlation of generation with demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power. [42] [43] [44]",

        "text": "At times of low load where non-dispatchable output from wind and solar may be high, grid stability requires lowering the output of various dispatchable generating sources or even increasing controllable loads, possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand. Such mechanisms can include: Pumped storage hydropower is the most prevalent existing technology used, and can substantially improve the economics of wind power. The availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid.  Typical round trip efficiency is 80%. [10] [70] Traditional lithium-ion is the most common type used for grid-scale battery storage as of 2020 [update] . [71] Rechargeable flow batteries can serve as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium. [13] Hydrogen can be created through electrolysis and stored for later use. [72] Flywheel energy storage systems have some advantages over chemical batteries. Along with substantial durability which allows them to be cycled frequently without noticeable life reduction, they also have very fast response and ramp rates. They can go from full discharge to full charge within a few seconds. [73] They can be manufactured using non-toxic and environmentally friendly materials, easily recyclable once the service life is over. [74] Thermal energy storage stores heat. Stored heat can be used directly for heating needs or converted into electricity. In the context of a CHP plant a heat storage can serve as a functional electricity storage at comparably low costs. Ice storage air conditioning Ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand. Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed. Storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient. Storage also requires capital investment and space for storage facilities.",

        "text": "The variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines, for example, in a wind farm, results in lower statistical variation, as long as the correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system. [75] Multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations. Wind output can be predicted with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts, especially from large numbers of turbines/farms. The ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected, especially from newer facilities. [75] Electricity produced from solar energy tends to counterbalance the fluctuating supplies generated from wind.  Normally it is windiest at night and during cloudy or stormy weather, and there is more sunshine on clear days with less wind. [76] Besides, wind energy has often a peak in the winter season, whereas solar energy has a peak in the summer season; the combination of wind and solar reduces the need for dispatchable backup power.

The images below show two weeks in 2022 in Germany, where renewable energy has a share of over 40%. [107] Prices also drop every night and weekend due to low demand. In hours without PV and wind power, electricity prices rise. This can lead to demand side adjustments. While industry is dependent on the hourly prices, most private households still pay a fixed tariff. With smart meters , private consomers can also be motivated i.e. to load an electric car when enough renewable energy is available and prices are cheap. Steerable flexibility in electricity production is essential to back up variable energy sources. The German example shows that pumped hydro storage, gas plants and hard coal jump in fast. Lignite varies on a daily basis. Nuclear power and biomass can theoretically adjust to a certain extent. However, in this case incentives still seem not be high enough.",
