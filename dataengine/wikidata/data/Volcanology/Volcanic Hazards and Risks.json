        "text": "Sulfate aerosols promote complex chemical reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O 3 ). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as acid rain . The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles. [18] Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain. Volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 teragrams (145 million to 255 million short tons ) of carbon dioxide each year. [19] Volcanic eruptions may inject aerosols into the Earth's atmosphere . Large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global climate mainly by cooling it. Volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to soil through the weathering process of volcanic rocks. These fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops. Volcanic eruptions can also create new islands, as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water. [ citation needed ]",

        "text": "According to John Ewert and Ed Miller in a 1995 publication, \"a great majority of the world's potentially active volcanoes are unmonitored\". Of the historically active volcanoes in the world, less than one fourth are monitored. Only twenty-four volcanoes in the entire world are thoroughly monitored for activity. They also state that \"seventy-five percent of the largest explosive eruptions since 1800 occurred at volcanoes that had no previous historical eruptions\". [29] By monitoring the seismic and geological activity, the USGS can warn people ahead of time about impending danger. These volcanologists measure the size of an eruption in two ways: the eruption magnitude (by the volume or mass of magma erupted) and eruption intensity (by the rate of magma erupted). [30] Various forms of satellites and imagery, such as satellite InSAR imagery, monitor the activity that isn't exposed to the naked eye. [31] Drones in combination with lightweight gas sensors become increasingly popular in volcanic monitoring, as the use of drones allows the researcher to increase the distance to the volcanic vent and therefore reduce the risk associated with gas sampling directly at the crater. Miniaturizing said systems offers the possibility to increase the measurement frequency by reducing weight and cost and therefore improve monitoring. Commonly measured gases are CO 2 and SO 2 which allow to detect upcoming changes in volcanic activity, as it was already shown at e.g. Etna , Italy. [32] However, the situation has somewhat changed with the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction [33] and the Yokohama strategy since 1994. [34] The Global Assessment of Risk (GAR) report is a biennial review and analysis of natural hazards published by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). The report implements the UN Hyogo Framework for Action. [35] Zadeh et al. (2014) provide an overview on Risks and Societal Implications of extreme natural hazards and an assessment of the global risk of volcanos and contains an appeal to found a worldwide volcanological organization comparable to the WMO. [36] The EU has recently started major research programs dealing with risk assessment, compare: The British Geological Survey has various ongoing volcanology programs. [40]",

[34] Globally, the total number of deaths from natural disasters has been reduced by 75% over the last 100 years, due to the increased development of countries, increased preparedness, better education, better methods, and aid from international organizations. Since the global population has grown over the same time period, the decrease in number of deaths per capita is larger, dropping to 6% of the original amount.

For example, some volcanoes are polygenetic with more than one period of activity during their history; other volcanoes that become extinct after erupting exactly once are monogenetic (meaning \"one life\") and such volcanoes are often grouped together in a geographical region.

Most cinder cones erupt only once and some may be found in monogenetic volcanic fields that may include other features that form when magma comes into contact with water such as maar explosion craters and tuff rings . [16] Cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. Parícutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona are examples of cinder cones. In New Mexico , Caja del Rio is a volcanic field of over 60 cinder cones. Based on satellite images, it has been suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the Solar system too; on the surface of Mars and the Moon. [17] [18] [19] [20]",

They are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Classic examples include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mayon Volcano in the Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy. Ash produced by the explosive eruption of stratovolcanoes has historically posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations. The lavas of stratovolcanoes are higher in silica, and therefore much more viscous, than lavas from shield volcanoes. High-silica lavas also tend to contain more dissolved gas. The combination is deadly, promoting explosive eruptions that produce great quantities of ash, as well as pyroclastic surges like the one that destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre in Martinique in 1902. They are also steeper than shield volcanoes, with slopes of 30–35° compared to slopes of generally 5–10°, and their loose tephra are material for dangerous lahars . [21] Large pieces of tephra are called volcanic bombs . Big bombs can measure more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) across and weigh several tons. [22]",

Volcanic activity during the Holocene Epoch has been documented at only 119 submarine volcanoes, but there may be more than one million geologically young submarine volcanoes on the ocean floor. [27] [28] In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the deep ocean basins, the tremendous weight of the water prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, submarine eruptions can be detected by hydrophones and by the discoloration of water because of volcanic gases . Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface, due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy in water (as compared to air), which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on chemotrophs feeding on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts . In May and June 2018, a multitude of seismic signals were detected by earthquake monitoring agencies all over the world. They took the form of unusual humming sounds, and some of the signals detected in November of that year had a duration of up to 20 minutes. An oceanographic research campaign in May 2019 showed that the previously mysterious humming noises were caused by the formation of a submarine volcano off the coast of Mayotte . [29]",

Magma rich in silica is much more viscous than silica-poor magma, and silica-rich magma also tends to contain more dissolved gases. Lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions: [39] Mafic lava flows show two varieties of surface texture: ʻAʻa (pronounced [ˈʔaʔa] ) and pāhoehoe ( [paːˈho.eˈho.e] ), both Hawaiian words. ʻAʻa is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is the typical texture of cooler basalt lava flows. Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Pāhoehoe flows are sometimes observed to transition to ʻaʻa flows as they move away from the vent, but never the reverse. [53] More silicic lava flows take the form of block lava, where the flow is covered with angular, vesicle-poor blocks. Rhyolitic flows typically consist largely of obsidian . [54]",

[36] [37] Tephra and other volcaniclastics (shattered volcanic material) make up more of the volume of many volcanoes than do lava flows.

[60] Volcanoes are informally described as erupting , active , dormant , or extinct , but the definitions of these terms are not entirely uniform amongst volcanologists. The level of activity of most volcanoes falls upon a graduated spectrum, with much overlap between categories, and does not always fit neatly into only one of these three separate categories. [61]",

        "text": "The USGS defines a dormant volcano as any volcano that is not showing any signs of unrest such as earthquake swarms, ground swelling, or excessive noxious gas emissions, but which shows signs that it could yet become active again. [63] Many dormant volcanoes have not erupted for thousands of years, but have still shown signs that they may be likely to erupt again in the future. [64] [65] In an article justifying the re-classification of Alaska's Mount Edgecumbe volcano from \"dormant\" to \"active\", volcanologists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory pointed out that the term \"dormant\" in reference to volcanoes has been deprecated over the past few decades and that \"[t]he term \"dormant volcano\" is so little used and undefined in modern volcanology that the Encyclopedia of Volcanoes (2000) does not contain it in the glossaries or index\", [66] however the USGS still widely employs the term. Previously a volcano was often considered to be extinct if there were no written records of its activity. Such a generalisation is inconsistent with observation and deeper study, as has occurred recently with the unexpected eruption of the Chaitén volcano in 2008. [67] Modern volcanic activity monitoring techniques, and improvements in the modelling of the factors that produce eruptions, have helped the understanding of why volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time, and then become unexpectedly active again. The potential for eruptions, and their style, depend mainly upon the state of the magma storage system under the volcano, the eruption trigger mechanism and its timescale. [68] : 95 For example, the Yellowstone volcano has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and Toba of around 380,000 years. [69] Vesuvius was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its unexpected eruption of 79 CE , which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii . Accordingly, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between an extinct volcano and a dormant (inactive) one. Long volcano dormancy is known to decrease awareness. [68] : 96 Pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas, and initially not seismically monitored before its unanticipated and catastrophic eruption of 1991. Two other examples of volcanoes which were once thought to be extinct, before springing back into eruptive activity were the long-dormant Soufrière Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat , thought to be extinct until activity resumed in 1995 (turning its capital Plymouth into a ghost town ) and Fourpeaked Mountain in Alaska, which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BCE.",

Edinburgh Castle in Scotland is located atop an extinct volcano, which forms Castle Rock . Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since \"supervolcano\" calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years may be considered dormant instead of extinct. An individual volcano in a monogenetic volcanic field can be extinct but that does not mean a completely new volcano might not erupt close by with little or no warning as its field may have an active magma supply.",

All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs , fumaroles , mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity. Volcanic gases can reach the stratosphere, where they form sulfuric acid aerosols that can reflect solar radiation and lower surface temperatures significantly. [72] Sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina may have caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603 . [73] Chemical reactions of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere can also damage the ozone layer , and acids such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) can fall to the ground as acid rain . Excessive fluoride salts from eruptions have poisoned livestock in Iceland on multiple occasions. [74] : 39–58 Explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles . [75] Ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft, especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. This can cause major disruptions to air travel. A volcanic winter is thought to have taken place around 70,000 years ago after the supereruption of Lake Toba on Sumatra island in Indonesia. [76] This may have created a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today. [77] Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to major extinction events, such as the End-Ordovician , Permian-Triassic , and Late Devonian mass extinctions . [78] The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the \" Year Without a Summer \" because of the effect on North American and European weather. [79] The freezing winter of 1740–41, which led to widespread famine in northern Europe, may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption. [80]",

        "text": "Earth's Moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core. [91] However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as maria [92] (the darker patches seen on the Moon), rilles [93] and domes . [94] The planet Venus has a surface that is 90% basalt , indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, [95] from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons , in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. [96] However, the interpretation of the flows as ash flows has been questioned. [97] There are several extinct volcanoes on Mars , four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons , Ascraeus Mons , Hecates Tholus , Olympus Mons , and Pavonis Mons . These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years, [98] but the European Mars Express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well. [98] Jupiter 's moon Io is the most volcanically active object in the Solar System because of tidal interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur , sulfur dioxide and silicate rock, and as a result, Io is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the Solar System, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the Solar System occurred on Io. [99] Europa , the smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons , also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as cryovolcanism , and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the Solar System . [100] In 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes) on Triton , a moon of Neptune , and in 2005 the Cassini–Huygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus , a moon of Saturn . [101] [102] The ejecta may be composed of water, liquid nitrogen , ammonia , dust, or methane compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan , which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere. [103] It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar . A 2010 study of the exoplanet COROT-7b , which was detected by transit in 2009, suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.

        "text": "Volcanic ash consists of small tephra , which are bits of pulverized rock and glass less than 2 millimetres (0.079 in) in diameter created by volcanic eruptions. [10] The ash enters the atmosphere from the force of the eruption and convection currents from the heated air, and is then carried away from the volcano by winds.  The ash with the smallest size can remain in the atmosphere for a considerable period of time, and can drift away from the eruption point. The ash cloud can be dangerous to aviation if it reaches the heights of aircraft flight paths. Pilots can't see ash clouds at night. Also, ash particles are too small to return an echo to on-board weather radars on commercial airliners.  Even when flying in daylight, pilots may interpret a visible ash cloud as a normal cloud of water vapour and not a danger—especially if the ash has travelled far from the eruption site. [8] [11] In the image from the Chaitén volcano , the ash cloud has spread thousands of kilometers from the eruption site, crossing the width of South America from the Pacific coast and spreading over the Atlantic. Volcanic ash has a melting point of approximately 1,100 °C (2,010 °F), which is below the operating temperature of modern commercial jet engines, about 1,400 °C (2,550 °F). Volcanic ash can damage gas turbines in a number of ways. These can be categorised into those that pose an immediate hazard to the engines and those that present a maintenance problem.",

        "text": "Volcanic ash is composed of fragments of rock, crystalline material, and volcanic glass. The glass component has the lowest melting temperature—lower than temperatures inside the combustor of a gas turbine engine. Ash that finds its way into the combustor may melt. Combustor and turbine components are cooled, as the metals they are made of have lower melting temperatures than the gas temperature inside the engine core. Molten ash that touches these surfaces is likely to freeze, and accrete on the metal surface. The most sensitive surface is the high-pressure turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), situated immediately downstream of the combustor. The gas flow is choked through the NGVs, and so the flow area through the NGVs is a controlling area for the engine. If this area is reduced due to an accretion of ash, a smaller mass flow rate of gas passes through the engine core. Reduced mass flow leads to the turbine doing less work. The turbine drives the compressor , which accordingly also does less work compressing the air. If the compressor can no longer contain the high pressure gas in the engine core, the gas flow can reverse and flow out of the front of the engine. This is known as an engine surge or a compressor surge, and is often accompanied by a ball of flame that bursts out the front of the engine. This surge is likely to extinguish the flame in the engine combustor, known as a 'flame-out'.\nOnce the high pressure in the core dissipates, the engine should be free to restart. Restarting an engine at altitude can be difficult, due to the lower temperatures and pressures of the ambient gas, but is not normally a problem. The reduced flow area of the NGVs can make it harder to restart the engine. Volcanic ash carries significant electrostatic charge. Fine ash that enters electronic components within the engine or airframe can cause electrical failure—which poses an immediate hazard to the aircraft. [12]",

        "text": "Due to the largely invisible nature of the underlying cause (CO 2 gas) behind limnic eruptions, it is difficult to determine to what extent eruptions have occurred in the past. The Roman historian Plutarch reports that in 406 BC, Lake Albano surged over the surrounding hills, despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level. [2] The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea. This event is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases, trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing, causing the water to overflow. [3] In recent history, this phenomenon has been observed twice. [4] The first recorded limnic eruption occurred in Cameroon at Lake Monoun in 1984, causing asphyxiation and death of 37 people living nearby. [5] A second, deadlier eruption happened at neighboring Lake Nyos in 1986, releasing over 80 million m 3 of CO 2 , killing around 1,700 people and 3,000 livestock, again by asphyxiation. [6] A third lake, the much larger Lake Kivu , rests on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda , and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO 2 . Sediment samples taken from the lake showed an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct around every 1,000 years, and caused nearby vegetation to be swept back into the lake. Limnic eruptions can be detected and quantified on a CO 2 concentration scale by taking air samples of the affected region. [7] The Messel pit fossil deposits of Messel , Germany , show evidence of a limnic eruption there in the early Eocene . Among the victims are perfectly preserved insects , frogs , turtles , crocodiles , birds , anteaters , insectivores , early primates , and paleotheres .",

        "text": "For a lake to undergo a limnic eruption, the water must be nearly saturated with gas. CO 2 was the primary component in the two observed cases, Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun. In Lake Kivu's case, scientists, including lake physicist Alfred Johny Wüest, were also concerned about the concentrations of methane . [8] [9] CO 2 may originate from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake, or from decomposition of organic material. Before a lake becomes saturated, it behaves like an unopened carbonated soft drink : the CO 2 is dissolved in the water. In both lakes and soft drinks, CO 2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure due to Henry's law . When the pressure is released, the CO 2 comes out of solution as bubbles of gas, which rise to the surface. CO 2 also dissolves more readily in cooler water, so very deep lakes can dissolve very large amounts of CO 2 since pressure increases, and temperature decreases, with depth. A small increase in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO 2 . Once a lake is saturated, it is very unstable and it gives off a smell of rotten eggs and gunpowder, but a trigger is needed to set off an eruption. [10] In the case of the 1986 Lake Nyos eruption, landslides were the suspected triggers, but a volcanic eruption, an earthquake , or even wind and rain storms can be potential triggers. Limnic eruptions can also be caused by gradual gas saturation at specific depths triggering spontaneous gas development. [11] Regardless of cause, the trigger pushes gas-saturated water higher in the lake, where the reduced pressure is insufficient to keep gas in solution. The buoyancy from the resulting bubbles lifts the water even higher, releasing yet more bubbles. This process forms a column of gas, at which point the water at the bottom is pulled up by suction , and it too loses CO 2 in a runaway process. This eruption discharges the gas into the air and can displace enough water to form a tsunami . Limnic eruptions are exceptionally rare for several reasons. First, a CO 2 source must exist; regions with volcanic activity are most at risk. Second, the vast majority of lakes are holomictic (their layers mix regularly), preventing a buildup of dissolved gases. Only meromictic lakes are stratified , allowing CO 2 to remain dissolved. It is estimated only one meromictic lake exists for every 1,000 holomictic lakes. [12] Finally, a lake must be very deep in order to have sufficiently pressurized water that can dissolve large amounts of CO 2 .",

Because CO 2 is denser than air, it has a tendency to sink to the ground, simultaneously displacing breathable air, resulting in asphyxia . CO 2 can make human bodily fluids highly acidic and potentially cause CO 2 poisoning . As victims gasp for air, they actually accelerate asphyxia by inhaling CO 2 . At Lake Nyos, the gas cloud descended into a nearby village where it settled, killing nearly everyone; casualties as far as 25 km (16 mi) were reported. [ citation needed ] A change in skin color on some bodies led scientists to hypothesize the gas cloud may have contained dissolved acid such as hydrogen chloride , though this hypothesis is disputed. [13] Many victims were found with blisters on their skin, thought to have been caused by pressure ulcers , which were likely caused by low blood oxygen levels in those asphyxiated by carbon dioxide. [14] Nearby vegetation was largely unaffected, except any growing immediately adjacent to the lake. There, vegetation was damaged or destroyed by a 24 m (79 ft) high tsunami caused by the violent eruption. [15]",

The part within the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a site of active armed conflict and low state capacity for the DRC government, which impedes both studies and any subsequent mitigating actions. Lake Kivu has not reached a high level of CO 2 saturation yet; if the water were to become heavily saturated, a limnic eruption would pose a great risk to human and animal life, potentially killing millions. [21] Two significant changes in Lake Kivu's physical state have brought attention to a possible limnic eruption: the high rates of methane dissociation and a rising surface temperature. [22] Research investigating historical and present-day temperatures show Lake Kivu's surface temperature is increasing by about 0.12 °C per decade. [22] Lake Kivu is in close proximity to potential triggers: Mount Nyiragongo (an active volcano which erupted in January 2002 and May 2021), an active earthquake zone, and other active volcanoes. [23] While the lake could be degassed in a manner similar to Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, due to the size of Lake Kivu and the volume of gas it contains, such an operation would be expensive, running into the millions of dollars. [ citation needed ] A scheme initiated in 2010 to use methane trapped in the lake as a fuel source to generate electricity in Rwanda has led to a degree of CO 2 degassing. [24] During the procedure for extracting the flammable methane gas used to fuel power stations on the shore, some CO 2 is removed in a process known as catalyst scrubbing . It is unclear whether enough gas will be removed to eliminate the danger of a limnic eruption at Lake Kivu.",
