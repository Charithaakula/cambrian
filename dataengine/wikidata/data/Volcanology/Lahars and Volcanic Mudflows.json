        "text": "The word lahar is a general term for a flowing mixture of water and pyroclastic debris. It does not refer to a particular rheology or sediment concentration. [4] Lahars can occur as normal stream flows (sediment concentration of less than 30%), hyper-concentrated stream flows (sediment concentration between 30 and 60%), or debris flows (sediment concentration exceeding 60%). Indeed, the rheology and subsequent behaviour of a lahar may vary in place and time within a single event, owing to changes in sediment supply and water supply. [4] Lahars are described as 'primary' or 'syn-eruptive' if they occur simultaneously with or are triggered by primary volcanic activity. 'Secondary' or 'post-eruptive' lahars occur in the absence of primary volcanic activity, e.g. as a result of rainfall during pauses in activity or during dormancy. [5] [6] In addition to their variable rheology, lahars vary considerably in magnitude. The Osceola Lahar produced by Mount Rainier in modern-day Washington some 5600 years ago resulted in a wall of mud 140 metres (460 ft) deep in the White River canyon and covered an area of over 330 square kilometres (130 sq mi), for a total volume of 2.3 cubic kilometres ( 1 ⁄ 2 cu mi). [7] A debris-flow lahar can erase virtually any structure in its path, while a hyperconcentrated-flow lahar is capable of carving its own pathway, destroying buildings by undermining their foundations. [5] A hyperconcentrated-flow lahar can leave even frail huts standing, while at the same time burying them in mud, [8] which can harden to near-concrete hardness. A lahar's viscosity decreases the longer it flows and can be further thinned by rain, producing a quicksand -like mixture that can remain fluidized for weeks and complicate search and rescue. [5] Lahars vary in speed. Small lahars less than a few metres wide and several centimetres deep may flow a few metres per second. Large lahars hundreds of metres wide and tens of metres deep can flow several tens of metres per second (22 mph or more), much too fast for people to outrun. [9] On steep slopes, lahar speeds can exceed 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph). [9] A lahar can cause catastrophic destruction along a potential path of more than 300 kilometres (190 mi). [10] Lahars from the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption in Colombia caused the Armero tragedy , burying the city of Armero under 5 metres (16 ft) of mud and debris and killing an estimated 23,000 people. [11] A lahar caused New Zealand's Tangiwai disaster , [12] where 151 people died after a Christmas Eve express train fell into the Whangaehu River in 1953. Lahars have caused 17% of volcano-related deaths between 1783 and 1997. [13]",

        "text": "Several mountains in the world – including Mount Rainier [14] in the United States, Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand, and Merapi [15] [16] and Galunggung in Indonesia [17] – are considered particularly dangerous due to the risk of lahars. Several towns in the Puyallup River valley in Washington state, including Orting , are built on top of lahar deposits that are only about 500 years old. Lahars are predicted to flow through the valley every 500 to 1,000 years, so Orting, Sumner , Puyallup , Fife , and the Port of Tacoma face considerable risk. [18] The USGS has set up lahar warning sirens in Pierce County, Washington , so that people can flee an approaching debris flow in the event of a Mount Rainier eruption. [19] A lahar warning system has been set up at Mount Ruapehu by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and hailed as a success after it successfully alerted officials to an impending lahar on 18 March 2007. [20] Since mid-June 1991, when violent eruptions triggered Mount Pinatubo 's first lahars in 500 years, a system to monitor and warn of lahars has been in operation. Radio-telemetered rain gauges provide data on rainfall in lahar source regions, acoustic flow monitors on stream banks detect ground vibration as lahars pass, and staffed watchpoints further confirm that lahars are rushing down Pinatubo's slopes. This system has enabled warnings to be sounded for most but not all major lahars at Pinatubo, saving hundreds of lives. [21] Physical preventative measures by the Philippine government were not adequate to stop over 6 m (20 ft) of mud from flooding many villages around Mount Pinatubo from 1992 through 1998. [22] Scientists and governments try to identify areas with a high risk of lahars based on historical events and computer models . Volcano scientists play a critical role in effective hazard education by informing officials and the public about realistic hazard probabilities and scenarios (including potential magnitude, timing, and impacts); by helping evaluate the effectiveness of proposed risk-reduction strategies; by helping promote acceptance of (and confidence in) hazards information through participatory engagement with officials and vulnerable communities as partners in risk reduction efforts; and by communicating with emergency managers during extreme events. [23] An example of such a model is TITAN2D . [24] These models are directed towards future planning: identifying low-risk regions to place community buildings, discovering how to mitigate lahars with dams, and constructing evacuation plans.

The lahars picked up speed in gullies and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the town of Armero , killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants. [26] Casualties in other towns, particularly Chinchiná , brought the overall death toll to over 25,000.

The eye of Typhoon Yunya passed over the volcano during its eruption on 15 June 1991, and the resulting rain triggered the flow of volcanic ash , boulders, and water down rivers surrounding the volcano. Angeles City in Pampanga and neighbouring cities and towns were damaged by lahars when Sapang Balen Creek and the Abacan River became channels for mudflows and carried them to the heart of the city and surrounding areas. [30] Over 6 metres (20 ft) of mud inundated and damaged the towns of Castillejos , San Marcelino and Botolan in Zambales , Porac and Mabalacat in Pampanga , Tarlac City , Capas , Concepcion and Bamban in Tarlac . [8] The Bamban Bridge on the MacArthur Highway, a major north–south transportation route, was destroyed, and temporary bridges erected in its place were inundated by subsequent lahars. [31] On the morning of 1 October 1995, pyroclastic material which clung to the slopes of Pinatubo and surrounding mountains rushed down because of heavy rain, and turned into an 8-metre (25 ft) lahar. This mudflow killed at least 100 people in Barangay Cabalantian in Bacolor . [32] The Philippine government under President Fidel V. Ramos ordered the construction of the FVR Mega Dike in an attempt to protect people from further mudflows. [33] Typhoon Reming triggered additional lahars in the Philippines in 2006. [34]",

        "text": "On November 13, 1985, the volcano Nevado del Ruiz erupted. At 9:09 pm of that evening, pyroclastic flows exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at 6 meters (20 ft) per second (~13.5 miles per hour, ~22 km/h), the first pulse enveloped most of the town of Armero , killing as many as 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby Chinchiná . [2] In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed. [3] Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger. [4] There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the \"Sleeping Lion\". [5] During September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October; [nb 1] it highlighted the danger from falling ash and rock near Murillo , Santa Isabel , and Líbano , as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita , Guayabal , Chinchiná, and Armero. [7] The map was poorly distributed to those at greatest risk: many survivors said they had not known  of it, though several major newspapers had featured it. [6] Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but were \"met with strong opposition from economic interests\". [8] He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution. [8] The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with a guerrilla campaign in Bogotá , the national capital. [9] The death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings, [4] unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, [10] and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano. [4] Colombia's worst natural disaster, [11] the Armero tragedy (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée ). [12] It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. [13] Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history. [14]",

        "text": "In late 1984, geologists noticed that seismic activity had begun to increase in the area around Nevado del Ruiz. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Ruiz's volcanic edifice. [14] An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and found them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide , indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for government officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. [15] Another team gave the local officials seismographs , but no instructions on how to operate them. [16] Volcanic activity increased again in November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur began to appear in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Ruiz became enriched with magnesium , calcium , and potassium , which leached from the magma. [14] The thermodynamic equilibration temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, ranged from 200 to 600 °C (400 to 1,100 °F); this is a measure of the temperature at which the gases equilibrated within the volcano. The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano in the space above the magma, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption. [17]",

        "text": "In September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a hazard map was finalized for the area around Ruiz. [nb 1] This map highlighted the danger from falling material—including ash and rock —near Murillo , Santa Isabel , and Libano , as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita , Guayabal , Chinchiná and Armero. [19] The map was poorly distributed to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had never heard of it, even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map. [18] Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero would be affected by lahars, but that the map \"met with strong opposition from economic interests\". He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult. [20] At least one of the hazard maps, published in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá, included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone, wrongly interpreted to indicate the safest area. [20] Another map published by the El Tiempo newspaper featured illustrations which \"gave a perception of topography to the public unfamiliar with maps, allowing them to relate hazard zones to the landscape\". In spite of this presentation that was keyed to the audience, the map ended up a more artistic representation of the risk than a purely scientific one. [20] The day of the eruption, black ash columns erupted from Ruiz at approximately 3:00 p.m. local time. The local civil defense director was promptly alerted to the situation. He contacted INGEOMINAS, which ruled that the area should be evacuated; he was then told to contact the civil defense directors in Bogotá and Tolima. Between 5:00–7:00 p.m., the ash stopped falling, and local officials, including the town priest, instructed people to \"stay calm\" and go inside. [21] Around 5:00 p.m. an emergency committee meeting was called, and when it ended at 7:00 p.m., several members contacted the regional Red Cross over the intended evacuation efforts at Armero, Mariquita, and Honda . [22] The Ibagué Red Cross contacted Armero's officials and ordered an evacuation, which was not carried out because of electrical problems caused by a storm. The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered the noise of the volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45 p.m., after the volcano had erupted, civil defense officials from Ibagué and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the mayor of Armero speaking on a ham radio , saying \"that he did not think there was much danger\" just before he was overtaken by the lahar.

        "text": "At 9:09 p.m., on November 13, 1985, [23] Nevado del Ruiz ejected dacitic tephra more than 30 km (20 mi) into the atmosphere. [14] The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million metric tons, [14] only three percent of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. [24] The eruption reached 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index . [25] The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 metric tons, or about two percent of the mass of the erupted solid material, [14] making the eruption unusually sulfur rich. [26] The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, [27] destroying a small lake that was observed in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow. [14] The lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice , and other rocks, [27] incorporated clay from eroding soil as they traveled down the volcano's flanks. [28] They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of 60 km/h (40 mph), dislodging rock and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars followed the six river valleys leading from the volcano, where they grew to almost four times their original volume. In the Gualí River, a lahar reached a maximum width of 50 m (160 ft). [27] Survivors in Armero described the night as \"quiet\". Volcanic ash had been falling throughout the day, but residents were informed it was nothing to worry about. Later in the afternoon, ash began falling again after a long period of quiet. Local radio stations reported that residents should remain calm and ignore the material. One survivor reported going to the fire department to be informed that the ash was \"nothing\". [29] During the night, the electrical power suddenly turned off and the radios went silent. Just before 11:30 p.m., a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they believed to be a flood. [30] At 11:30 p.m., the first lahar hit, followed shortly by the others. [30] One of the lahars virtually erased Armero; three-quarters of the town's 28,700 inhabitants were killed. [27] Proceeding in three major waves, this lahar was 30 m (100 ft) deep, moved at 12 m/s (39 ft/s; 27 mph), and lasted ten to twenty minutes. Traveling at about six m/s (20 ft/s; 13 mph), the second lahar lasted thirty minutes and was followed by smaller pulses. [31] A third major pulse brought the lahar's duration to roughly two hours. By that point, 85 percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people holding on to debris from their homes in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down debris. [31] The front of the lahar contained boulders and cobbles that would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts — the eyes, ears, and mouth — and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia in one or two minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia , though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm. [31] Another lahar, which descended through the valley of the Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed 400 homes in Chinchiná. [6] In total, more than 23,000 people were killed, approximately 5,000 were injured, and 5,000 homes [27] throughout thirteen villages [29] were destroyed. Some 230,000 people were affected, 27,000 acres (11,000 ha) were disrupted, and there were nearly 20,000 survivor-refugees. [32] The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée , [33] and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption recorded since 1500 AD. [34] It is also the deadliest lahar, [35] and Colombia's worst natural disaster. [36]",

[37] Because its last substantial eruption had occurred 140 years earlier, it was difficult for many to accept the danger presented by the volcano; locals even called it the \"Sleeping Lion\". [9] Hazard maps showing that Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. [38] The eruption occurred at the height of guerrilla warfare in Bogotá, and so the government and army were preoccupied at the time of the eruption. [16] The day after the eruption, relief workers in Armero were appalled at its impact. The lahars had left behind a gray mass which covered the entire town, which was dotted with broken trees and horribly disfigured bodies. [39] Debris from huts and homes protruded from beneath the gray mud. A few bags filled with crops were discovered in the mud. Workers described an acrid smell of \"rotting bodies, ... wood smoke and decaying vegetables\". [5] To the horror of these workers, who were scrambling to begin relief efforts, survivors let out moans of pain and agony. The damages were assessed at one billion dollars, an amount approximately one-fifth of Colombia's 1985 gross national product . [39] As news of the catastrophe spread around the world, the ongoing Colombian presidential campaign was halted, and the guerrilla fighters stopped their campaign \"in view of the painful tragedy that has befallen our nation\". Tickets for Colombian national championship soccer games added a surcharge of five cents to go to relief efforts. [40] Scientists who later analyzed the seismograph data noticed that several long-period earthquakes (which begin strongly and then slowly die out) had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that \"the volcano was screaming, 'I'm about to explode'\", but the scientists who were studying Ruiz at the time of the eruption were not able to read the signal.

        "text": "Nevado del Ruiz continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. [53] Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated , a significant volume of ice still sits atop Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just ten percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200 × 10 ^ 6 m 3 (7.1 × 10 ^ 9 cu ft) – similar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100 km (62 mi) along river valleys. [35] Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 individuals being considered to be at high risk. [53] Lahars pose a threat to the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Chinchiná, Ambalema , Herveo , Villa Hermosa , Puerto Salgar and La Dorada . [54] Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. [53] A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall. [55] As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, [37] unwise land use, [56] and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, [37] the Colombian government created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness) [57] – to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, [56] and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. [58] When another Colombian volcano, Nevado del Huila , erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another \"Nevado del Ruiz\". [59] The lessons from the Armero tragedy have inspired a lahar warning system for Mt. Rainier in Washington State , which has a similar potential for lahars. [60] Armero was never rebuilt after the tragedy. Instead, the survivors were relocated to the towns of Guayabal and Lérida , rendering Armero a ghost town .",

        "text": "Heavy rainfall, snowmelt , or high levels of groundwater flowing through cracked bedrock may trigger a movement of soil or sediments in landslides that continue as mudflows. Floods and debris flows may also occur when strong rains on hill or mountain slopes cause extensive erosion and/or mobilize loose sediment that is located in steep mountain channels. The 2006 Sidoarjo mud flow may have been caused by rogue drilling. The point where a muddy material begins to flow depends on its grain size, the water content, and the slope of the topography. Fine grained material like mud or sand can be mobilized by shallower flows than a coarse sediment or a debris flow.  Higher water content (higher precipitation/overland flow) also increases the potential to initiate a mudflow. [7] After a mudflow forms, coarser sediment may be picked up by the flow.   Coarser sediment picked up by the flow often forms the front of a mudflow surge and is pushed by finer sediment and water that pools up behind the coarse-grained moving mudflow-front. [8] Mudflows may contain multiple surges of material as the flow scours channels and destabilizes adjacent hillslopes (potentially nucleating new mudflows). [9] Mudflows have mobilized boulders 1–10 m across in mountain settings. [10] Some broad mudflows are rather viscous and therefore slow; others begin very quickly and continue like an avalanche . They are composed of at least 50% silt and clay-sized materials and up to 30% water. Because mudflows mobilize a significant amount of sediment, mudflows have higher flow heights than a clear water flood for the same water discharge.  Also, sediment within the mudflow increases granular friction within the flow structure of the flow relative to clear water floods, which raises the flow depth for the same water discharge. [11] Difficulty predicting the amount and type of sediment that will be included in a mudflow makes it much more challenging to forecast and engineer structures to protect against mudflow hazards compared to clear water flood hazards. Mudflows are common even in the hills around Los Angeles , California, where they have destroyed many homes built on hillsides without sufficient support after fires destroy vegetation holding the land. On 14 December 1999 in Vargas , Venezuela , a mudflow known as The Vargas tragedy significantly altered more than 60 kilometers (37 mi) of the coastline. It was triggered by heavy rainfall and caused estimated damages of US$1.79 to US$3.5 billion, killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people, forced 85,000 people to evacuate , and led to the complete collapse of the state's infrastructure.",

        "text": "Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. [12] Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma might have begun moving below the volcano . [13] On March 20, at 3:45 pm Pacific Standard Time , a shallow, magnitude-4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, [13] signaled the volcano's return from 123 years of hibernation. [14] A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale . [15] A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater was recorded during those two days. [16] Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May, with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. [14] Initially, no direct sign of eruption was seen, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations. At 12:36 pm on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater ) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater , excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, [14] [17] [18] [19] and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. [16] By this date, a 16,000-foot-long (4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. [20] This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400 m) above their vent. [14] Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 mi (5 and 19 km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 mi (240 km) south to Bend, Oregon , or 285 mi (460 km) east to Spokane, Washington . [21] A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29. [21] [22] The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 mi (3 km) long. [21] Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30, [21] and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3. [22] Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a \"red zone\" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine (equivalent to $1,800 in 2023) or six months in jail. [23] [24] This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property. [25] By April 7, the combined crater was 1,700 by 1,200 ft (520 by 370 m) and 500 ft (150 m) deep. [26] A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5 mi-diameter (2.4 km) section of St. Helens's north face was displaced outward by at least 270 ft (82 m). [20] For the rest of April and early May, this bulge grew by 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) per day, and by mid-May, it extended more than 400 ft (120 m) north. [20] As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben . Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption. [24] [27] These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0.03 cu mi (0.13 km 3 ) by mid-May. [28] This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruding magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome , in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface. On May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the following days, the bulge approached its maximum size. [29] All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. About 10,000 earthquakes were recorded before the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6 mi (2.6 km) directly below the bulge. [28] Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area. [30] Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on Saturday, May 17, to gather whatever property they could carry. [30] [31] Another trip was scheduled for 10 am the next day, [30] [31] and because that was Sunday, more than 300 loggers who would normally be working in the area were not there. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 ft (150 m) and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).",

        "text": "As May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens's activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rates of bulge movement and sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post around 6 mi (10 km) north of the volcano: as of 6:00 am, Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity. [9] At 8:32 am, a magnitude-5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide, [32] approximately 7–20 seconds after the shock, [9] followed a few seconds later by the main volcanic blast . The landslide, the largest subaerial landslide in recorded history, traveled at 110 to 155 mph (177 to 249 km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a 1,150 ft-high (350 m) ridge about 6 mi (10 km) north. [9] Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13 mi (21 km) down the North Fork Toutle River , filling its valley up to 600 feet (180 m) deep with avalanche debris. [32] An area of about 24 sq mi (62 km 2 ) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cu mi (2.9 km 3 ). [9] Scientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 mi (18 km) away from the blast 46°18′49″N 122°02′12″W ﻿ / ﻿ 46.31361°N 122.03667°W ﻿ / 46.31361; -122.03667 . [9] Rosenquist, his party, and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mi (1.6 km) short of his location. [33] Most of St. Helens's former north side became a rubble deposit 17 mi (27 km) long, averaging 150 ft (46 m) thick; the slide was thickest at 1 mi (1.6 km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin. [9] The landslide temporarily displaced the waters of Spirit Lake to the ridge north of the lake, in a giant wave about 600 ft (180 m) high. [34] This, in turn, created a 295 ft (90 m) avalanche of debris consisting of the returning waters and thousands of uprooted trees and stumps. Some of these remained intact with roots, but most had been sheared off at the stump seconds earlier by the blast of superheated volcanic gas and ash that had immediately followed and overtaken the initial landslide. The debris was transported along with the water as it returned to its basin , raising the surface level of Spirit Lake by about 200 ft (61 m). [9] Four decades after the eruption, floating log mats persist on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake, changing position with the wind. The rest of the trees, especially those that were not completely detached from their roots, were turned upright by their own weight and became waterlogged, sinking into the muddy sediments at the bottom where they are in the process of becoming petrified in the anaerobic and mineral-rich waters. This provides insight into other sites with a similar fossil record. [35]",

        "text": "The landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens's neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast directed the pyroclastic flow laterally. It consisted of very hot volcanic gases, ash, and pumice formed from new lava, as well as pulverized old rock, which hugged the ground. Initially moving about 220 mph (350 km/h), the blast quickly accelerated to around 670 mph (1,080 km/h), and it may have briefly passed the speed of sound . [9] [32] Pyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37 km × 31 km). [32] In total, about 230 sq mi (600 km 2 ) of forest were knocked down, [32] and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent, the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30 seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute. Superheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia , [36] Montana , Idaho , and Northern California , yet many areas closer to the eruption ( Portland, Oregon , for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \"quiet zone\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers, and to a lesser extent, local topography. [9] Later studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045 cu mi (0.19 km 3 ) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock. [36]",

        "text": "As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 mi (19 km) above the expanding crater in less than 10 minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours. [36] Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning , which in turn started many forest fires . During this time, parts of the mushroom -shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud, and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens's flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water, which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65 ft (20 m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500 ft (2,000 m) into the air. [41] Strong, high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed around 60 miles per hour (100 km/h). By 9:45 am, it had reached Yakima, Washington , 90 mi (140 km) away, and by 11:45 am, it was over Spokane, Washington . [9] A total of 4 to 5 in (100 to 130 mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon, where visibility was reduced to 10 ft (3 m) and 0.5 in (13 mm) of ash fell. [36] Continuing eastward, [42] St. Helens's ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15 pm, and was seen on the ground in Denver the next day. [36] In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma , and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2 weeks. During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons (540 × 10 ^ 6 short tons or 490 × 10 ^ 6 t) of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 sq mi (57,000 km 2 ). [9] The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cu mi (1.3 km 3 ). [9] The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cu mi (0.21 km 3 ) of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche. [9] By around 5:30 pm on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days. [43]",

        "text": "The hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers, along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows ) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain, [41] and which started to move as early as 8:50 am. [34] Lahars travelled as fast as 90 mph (140 km/h) while still high on the volcano, but progressively slowed to about 3 mph (4.8 km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers. [9] Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek, and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River . Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6 ft (0.79 m) [41] by noon to accommodate the nearly 18,000,000 cu yd (14,000,000 m 3 ) of additional water, mud, and debris. [9] Glacier and snowmelt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington , at 1:00 pm. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27 mi (43 km) upstream, where observers at Weyerhaeuser 's Camp Baker saw a 12 ft-high (4 m) wall of muddy water and debris pass. [34] Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of 23.5 ft (7.2 m) was recorded. [34] A large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30 pm, the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker, [34] and in the following hours, seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5 mi (4.0 km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling 17 mi (27 km) further, an estimated 3,900,000 cu yd (3,000,000 m 3 ) of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river's depth by 25 ft (8 m) for a 4 mi (6 km) stretch. [34] The resulting 13 ft (4.0 m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters , costing Portland, Oregon, an estimated $5 million (equivalent to $15.5 million 2023). [43] Ultimately, more than 65 × 10 ^ 6 cu yd (50 × 10 ^ 6 m 3 ; 1.8 × 10 ^ 9 cu ft) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers. [9]",

Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems, clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts . [9] Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2,400,000 cu yd (1,800,000 m 3 ) of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington. The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima. [9] The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills ; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots. [56]",

A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration , U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , and the Federal Emergency Management Agency . [9] Also, indirect and intangible costs of the eruption were incurred. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose 10-fold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental-health programs to assist such people. [9] Initial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens– Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The U.S. Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation. [9]",

[51] The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity, and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars, and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption. [51] At 7:05 pm on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5 mi (4.0 km) above the volcano. At 9:09 pm, a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 mi (16 km) skyward. [57] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival. [58] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 ft (61 m) and a width of 1,200 ft (370 m) within a week. [57] A series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14 pm as an ash column shot 10 mi (16 km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25 pm that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5 minutes. [57] The final explosion started at 7:01 pm, and continued over two hours. [57] When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone. [59] Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26 pm, an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 mi (13 km) into the sky. [59] Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32 pm, when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north. [59] A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later. Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 mi in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows. [59] A third dome began to form within 30 minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900 ft (270 m) wide and 130 ft (40 m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater. All of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987, the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000 ft (910 m) wide and 800 ft (240 m) high. [59] Further eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.",

From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about 1,500 km 2 (600 sq mi) of the Ruiz–Tolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered 800 km 2 (300 sq mi). During the Little Ice Age , which lasted from about 1600 to 1900 CE, the ice cap covered approximately 100 km 2 (40 sq mi). [18] Since then the glaciers have retreated further because of atmospheric warming. [8] By 1959, the massif's glaciated area had dropped to 34 km 2 (13 sq mi). [19] Since the 1985 eruption, which destroyed about 10% of the summit ice cover, the area of Nevado del Ruiz covered by glaciers has halved—from 17 to 21 km 2 (6.6 to 8.1 sq mi) just after the eruption to about 10 km 2 (3.9 sq mi) in 2003. The glaciers reached altitudes as low as 4,500 m (14,800 ft) in 1985 but have now retreated to elevations of 4,800–4,900 m (15,700–16,100 ft). [8] The ice cap is approximately 50 m (160 ft) thick on average. It is thickest in parts of the summit plateau and under the Nereides Glacier on the southwestern slopes, where it is as deep as 190 m (620 ft). Glaciers on the northern and, to a lesser extent, the eastern slopes lost the most ice in the 1985 eruption, [20] and therefore reach only up to 30 m (100 ft) deep. [21] The deep ice covering the summit plateau may hide a caldera. Five domes ringing the summit plateau have emerged as the ice has retreated. [21] The meltwater from the glaciers drains primarily to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively. [16] Runoff from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes is a source of fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' water supply should the glaciers melt completely.

[5] Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano's glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to 2,000,000 m 3 (70,629,333 cu ft)—similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. [8] Such lahars can travel up to 100 km (62 mi) along river valleys in a matter of few hours. [8] Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are in danger, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. [5] [nb 2] Lahars pose a threat to nearby towns of Honda , Mariquita , Ambalema , Chinchiná, Herveo , Villa Hermosa , Salgar and La Dorada . [46] Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. [5] A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall. [45] As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, [41] unwise land use, [47] and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, [41] the government of Colombia created a special program ( Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres , 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning in order to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, [47] and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. [48] When another Colombian volcano, the Nevado del Huila , erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another \"Nevado del Ruiz\". [49] In October 2022, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) listed Nevado del Ruiz as one of 100 \"geological heritage sites\" for being among the \"best-studied volcanoes in the world\" and a \"model for volcanic risk management\". [50] In 2006, heavy rains on Ruiz sent a mudslide down the Chinchiná River, killing nine children aged 12–19 on a scouting expedition near the volcano. [51]",

Upon detection of a lahar, the computer alerts local 24–hour emergency monitoring and notification centers, who initiate the warning component of the system.

[5] All Hazard Alert Broadcast (AHAB) Sirens: The Mount Rainier Lahar Siren project is part of an overall emergency communications system for Pierce County. The focus for the sirens is to warn the residents in the Puyallup River Valley of the need to evacuate due to a volcanic disaster from the Mount Rainier Volcano. Over 40 Federal Signal Modulator sirens are strategically placed through the valley. When imminent volcanic danger threatens, the sirens will be activated, utilizing the emergency “wailing” tone. Citizens will be advised to evacuate the valley floor and head to higher ground by vehicle or foot. The outdoor lahar warning sirens are tested at noon on the first Monday of months January-September, November-December, using the “ Westminster Chime ” tone for eight seconds followed by a voice announcement to ensure the sirens are working. Every October on the first Monday at Noon, the emergency warbling “wail” tone is tested for approximately five minutes. [6] During a real volcanic event or other disaster, the sirens will continuously “wail” in 5 minute increments to warn residents and tourists to evacuate. They will continue to wail until the batteries die or the sirens themselves are destroyed by the lahar. [7]",

        "text": "On July 16, 1990, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Central Luzon and the Cordilleras . This was the largest earthquake recorded in 1990, [5] [6] comparable in size to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake . Its epicenter was in the municipality of Rizal, Nueva Ecija , [7] about 100 km (62 mi) northeast of Pinatubo, and faulted northwest–southeast through three provinces. It also followed the Philippine Fault System west as far as Baguio , which was devastated, and is located about 80 km (50 mi) north-northeast of Pinatubo, leading volcanologists to speculate that it might ultimately have triggered the 1991 eruption, although this is impossible to prove conclusively. Two weeks after the earthquake, local residents reported steam coming from the volcano, but scientists who visited there in response found only small rockslides rather than any pre-eruptive activity. On March 15, 1991, a succession of earthquakes were felt by villagers on the northwestern side of the volcano. Further earthquakes of increasing intensity were felt over the next two weeks, and it became clear some kind of volcanic activity was likely. On April 2, the volcano woke up, with phreatic eruptions occurring near the summit along a 1.5 km (0.93 mi) long fissure . Over the next few weeks, small eruptions continued, dusting the surrounding areas with volcanic ash. Seismographs recorded hundreds of small earthquakes every day. [8] Scientists immediately installed monitoring equipment and analyzed the volcano for clues as to its previous eruptive history. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal found in old volcanic deposits revealed the last three major explosive eruption periods in recent millennia , about 5500, 3500 and 500 years ago. Geological mapping showed that much of the surrounding plains were formed by lahar flood deposits from previous eruptions. Volcanic activity increased throughout May. Measurements of sulfur dioxide emissions showed a rapid increase from 500 t (550 short tons) per day by May 13 to 5,000 t (5,500 short tons) per day by May 28. [9] [8] This implied that there was a rising column of fresh magma beneath the volcano. After May 28, the amount of SO 2 being emitted decreased substantially, raising fears that the degassing of the magma had been blocked somehow, leading to a pressure build-up in the magma chamber and a high likelihood of violent explosive eruptions. In early June, tiltmeter measurements had shown that the volcano was gradually inflating, evidently due to fast-growing amounts of magma filling the reservoir beneath the summit. At the same time, seismic activity, previously concentrated at a depth of a few kilometers below a point about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) northwest of the summit, shifted to shallow depths just below the summit. Such an event is a precursor of volcano tectonic earthquakes . Given all the signs that a very large eruption was imminent, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology – assisted by the United States Geological Survey – worked to convince local inhabitants of the high severity of the threat. A false warning might have led to cynicism about any later warnings, but delaying a warning until an eruption began might lead to thousands of deaths, so the volcanologists were under some pressure to deliver a timely and accurate assessment of the volcanic risk. [10] Three successive evacuation zones were defined, the innermost containing everything within 10 km (6.2 mi) of the volcano's summit, the second extending 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) from the summit, and the third extending from 20–40 km (12–25 mi) from the summit (Clark Air Base and Angeles City were in this zone). [10] The 10 km (6.2 mi) and 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) zones had a total population of about 40,000 inhabitants, while some more 331,000 inhabitants lived in the 20–40 km (12–25 mi) zone. Five stages of volcanic alert were defined, from level 1 (low level seismic disturbances) up to level 5 (major eruption in progress). Daily alerts were issued stating the alert level and associated danger area, and the information was announced in major regional and national newspapers , on radio and television stations, by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and directly to the endangered inhabitants. Many of the Aetas who lived on the slopes of the volcano left their villages of their own volition when the first blasts began in April, gathering in a village about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from the summit. They moved to increasingly distant settlements as the eruptions escalated, some Aetas moving up to nine times in the two months before the colossal eruption.\nThe first formal evacuations were ordered for the 10 km (6.2 mi) zone on April 7. Evacuation of the 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) zone was ordered when a level 4 alert was issued on June 7. A level 5 alert triggered evacuation of the 20–40 km (12–25 mi) zone on June 13, and in all some 60,000 people had left the area within 30 kilometres (19 mi) of the volcano before June 15. Most people temporarily relocated to Metro Manila , with some 30,000 using the Amoranto Velodrome in Quezon City as an evacuee camp . On June 7, the first magmatic eruptions took place with the formation of a lava dome at the summit of the volcano. The dome grew substantially over the next five days, reaching a maximum diameter of about 200 m (660 ft) and a height of 40 m (130 ft).",

        "text": "A small blast at 03:41 PST on June 12 marked the beginning of a new, more violent phase of the eruption. A few hours later the same day, massive blasts lasting about half an hour generated big eruption columns, which quickly reached heights of over 19 kilometres (62,000 ft) and which generated large pyroclastic surges extending up to four kilometres (2.5 mi) from the summit in some river valleys . Fourteen hours later, a 15-minute blast hurled volcanic matter to heights of 24 km (15 mi). Friction in the up-rushing ash column generated abundant volcanic lightning . A third large eruption began at 08:41 on June 13, after an intense swarm of small earthquakes over the previous two hours. It lasted about five minutes, and the eruption column once again reached 24 km (15 mi). After three hours of quiet, seismic activity began, growing more and more intense over the next twenty-four hours, until a three-minute eruptive blast generated a 21 km (13 mi) high eruption column at 13:09 on June 14. Tephra fall from these four large eruptions was extensive to the southwest of the volcano. Two hours after the last of these four explosions, a series of eruptions began which lasted for the next twenty-four hours, and which saw the production of much larger pyroclastic flows and surges which travelled several kilometres down river valleys on the flanks of the volcano. In total, almost 400 km 2 (150 sq mi) of land was buried by pyroclastic density currents which travelled in all directions, and reached at least 12 km (7.5 mi), and as far as 16 km (9.9 mi), from the volcano. The land closest to the eruption was eroded by the pyroclastic currents, which did not leave much deposit there. [11] Dacite was the dominant igneous rock making up the tephra in these eruptions and in the following climactic event. The most abundant phenocryst minerals were hornblende and plagioclase , but an unusual phenocryst mineral was also present – the calcium sulfate called anhydrite . The dacite magma was more oxidized than most magmas, and the sulfur-rich nature of the eruption was probably causally related to the redox state . [ citation needed ] The final, climactic eruption of Mount Pinatubo began at 13:42 PST on June 15. It caused numerous major earthquakes due to the collapse of the summit and the creation of a caldera 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter, reducing the peak from 1,745 m (5,725 ft) to 1,486 m (4,875 ft). [12] All the seismographs close to Clark Air Base had been rendered completely inoperative by 14:30, mostly by super-massive pyroclastic surges. Intense atmospheric pressure variation was also recorded. On the same day, Typhoon Yunya , locally named Diding, struck the island, with its center passing about 75 km (47 mi) north of the volcano. The typhoon rains mostly obscured the eruption, but measurements showed that ash was ejected to a height of 34 km (21 mi) by the most violent phase of the eruption, which lasted about three hours. Pyroclastic surges poured from the summit, reaching as far as 16 km (9.9 mi) away from their origin point. Typhoon rains and flooding, mixed with the ash deposits, caused a messy rain of mud and massive lahars. The volcanic column from the crater covered an area of some 125,000 km 2 (48,000 sq mi), bringing total darkness to much of Central Luzon for 36 hours. Almost all of the island received some wet ash fall, which formed a heavy, rain-saturated snow-like blanket. Tephra fell over most of the South China Sea and ash falls were recorded as far away as Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Twelve days after the first magmatic eruptions of June 3, on June 15, 1991, by about 22:30, and about nine hours after the onset of the most recent climactic phase, atmospheric pressure waves had decreased to the pre-eruption levels. No seismic records were available at this time, but volcanologists believe 22:30 PST marked the end of the climactic eruption. Vast quantities of light and heavy metal minerals were brought to the surface. Overall an estimated 800,000 t (880,000 short tons) of zinc -, 600,000 t (660,000 short tons) of copper -, 550,000 t (610,000 short tons) of chromium -, 300,000 t (330,000 short tons) of nickel -, and massive amounts of potentially toxic heavy metal mineral such as 100,000 t (110,000 short tons) of lead -, 10,000 t (11,000 short tons) of arsenic -, 1,000 t (1,100 short tons) of cadmium -, and 800 t (880 short tons) of mercury -minerals comingled with the other magmatic rock, came forth.

        "text": "The powerful eruption of such an enormous volume of lava and ash injected significant quantities of aerosols and dust into the stratosphere . Sulfur dioxide oxidized in the atmosphere to produce a haze of sulfuric acid droplets, which gradually spread throughout the stratosphere over the year following the eruption. The injection of aerosols into the stratosphere is thought to have been the largest since the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa , with a total mass of SO 2 of about 17,000,000 t (19,000,000 short tons) being injected – the largest volume ever recorded by modern instruments (see chart and figure ). This very large stratospheric injection resulted in a volcanic winter , a reduction in the normal amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by roughly 10% (see figure ). This led to a decrease in Northern Hemisphere average temperatures of 0.5–0.6 °C (0.9–1.1 °F) and a global decrease of about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F). [23] [24] The 1991 eruption also caused the \"Summer that Wasn't\" in 1992. [25] [26] [27] [28] The extremity of this volcanic winter has been called into question by some, however, with a more conservative estimate of a 0.2 °C decrease in global temperatures for 13 months also being given. [29] At the same time, the temperature in the stratosphere rose to several degrees higher than normal, due to the absorption of radiation by the aerosol. The stratospheric cloud from the eruption persisted in the atmosphere for three years. The eruption, while not directly responsible, may have played a part in the formation of the 1993 Storm of the Century . [30] The eruption had a significant effect on ozone levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of ozone. Ozone levels at middle latitudes reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the Southern Hemisphere winter of 1992, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded ozone depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere ozone destruction, with measurements showing a sharp decrease in ozone levels at the tropopause when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.\nAnother noticeable effect of the dust in the atmosphere was the appearance of lunar eclipses . Normally even at mid-eclipse, the Moon is still visible although much dimmed, whereas in the year following the Pinatubo eruption, the Moon was hardly visible at all during eclipses, due to much greater absorption of sunlight by dust in the atmosphere. It has also been suggested that excess cloud condensation nuclei from the eruption were responsible for the \" Great Flood of 1993 \" in the Midwestern United States . [31]",

        "text": "Between two and three million years ago, during the Pliocene , the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted westward. A series of volcanic mudflows ( lahars ) from three major source areas contributed debris that covered almost 2,000 sq mi (5,200 km 2 ) to form the oldest distinctive geologic formation in the High Cascades. [1] The resulting Tuscan Formation is not exposed anywhere in the national park but is just below the surface in many places within it. [11] It consists mainly of tuffs but also contains conglomerates and lava sheets. The formation can reach thicknesses exceeding 1,000 ft (300 m) [12] and is of late Pliocene age. An overlying rhyolitic lava flow gives an age of 1.5 million years. [13] Lassen is the fifth volcanic center to be active in the region. [14] Latour, Yana, Maidu and Dittmar were the four preceding centers; [14] Latour and Yana are only poorly known. [15] One major source of the formation was Mount Yana; centered a few miles (5 km) southwest of Butt Mountain and south of the park. Mount Yana had probably reached its full size of 10,000 ft (3,000 m) in elevation and 15 mi (24 km) in diameter before Mount Maidu, the second source, had acquired half its growth. Mount Maidu, which eventually surpassed Mount Yana in size, was centered over what is now the town of Mineral, California , but has been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years (the grassy plain around the town is Maidu's caldera ). [16] A third source situated north of Latour Butte made a lesser contribution to the formation. Minor sources included an area near Hatchet Mountain Pass (northwest of Burney Mountain ), dikes south and southwest of Inskip Hill and possibly Campbell Mound (north of Chico, California ). [1] Also during the Pliocene, basaltic lavas poured forth in the vicinity of Willow Lake in the southwestern portion of the park. [11] These were followed by a very thick sequence of very fluid andesitic lavas which erupted near Juniper Lake and flowed westward about four miles (6 km). [1] At about the same time, other andesitic lavas poured from several vents on the central plateau to cover an area of at least 30 sq mi (78 km 2 ). Included among these flows were the Twin Lake lavas of black porphyritic andesite, which are notable in that they contain xenocrysts of quartz . [17] The Flatiron andesites spread over the southwestern part of the park area around this time. [11] Somewhat later, andesitic lavas poured out from what is now Reading Peak and mainly flowed to the south and east, reaching the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. [1] The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. [11] These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these flows built the lava plateau upon which the Lassen volcanic area is located. [18]",

        "text": "The earliest volcanic activity of the Lassen Volcanic Center commenced 825,000 years ago. [2] The Rockland complex formed between 825,000 and 609,000 years ago. It was the source of lava domes and lava flows of dacitic composition. Around 610,000 years ago over 130 km 3 [19] of rhyolite magma violently erupted onto the surface, producing massive pyroclastic flows and an ash plume several tens of kilometers high. This plume distributed ash almost entirely over the state of Nevada and sending traces as far as southeastern Idaho . [20] As the eruption progressed the underlying magma chamber was severely drained. This caused the overlying rock that was once supported by the magma to collapse downward. Forming a massive depression known as a caldera. Over 326.7 km 3 of tephra was erupted during this event. [19] This could very well make the Rockland tephra the most voluminous eruption to have occurred in the Cascade Volcanic Arc , nearly twice the size of the Mazama ash . From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, [21] eruptions built a large conical stratovolcano called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) in what is now the southwest corner of the park [4] within the Rockland caldera complex. [22] It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra ( volcanic ash , breccia , and pumice ) with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation. [17] Tehama eventually reached an elevation of about 11,000 ft (3,400 m), [16] was 11 to 15 miles (18 to 24 km) wide at its base, [23] and contained 80 km 3 (19 cu mi) of material. [21] Its principal vent lay in the neighborhood of what is now Sulphur Works , but a second vent from which no lavas issued lay on the eastern flank of Little Hot Springs Valley . Contrary to popular belief, Bumpass Hell is not one of Tehama's main vents since it is located outside of the caldera. [1] Tehama collapsed during the late Pleistocene, [11] and numerous glacial advances tore down its remnants. [24] The largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. [24] Between about 385,000 and 315,000 years ago the character and locus of volcanism in the Lassen Volcanic Center changed dramatically from the andesitic ( silica content between basalt and dacite) stratocone to the Lassen domefield, which consists of a core of dacite lava domes surrounded by an arc of hybrid andesite flows. The dacite domes erupted along the northern flank of Brokeoff Volcano and are divided on the basis of age into the Bumpass sequence (about 300,000–190,000 years ago) and Eagle Peak sequence (about 70,000 years ago to present day). The hybrid andesite units erupted in two groups called the older Twin Lakes sequence (about 315,000 to 240,000 years ago, contemporaneous with the Bumpass Peak sequence) and younger Twin Lakes sequence (about 90,000 to present day, contemporaneous with the Eagle Peak sequence). No volcanism is known in the Lassen volcanic center during the period from 190,000 to 90,000 years ago. [25] Four shield volcanoes (Raker and Prospect Peaks, Red Mountain and Mount Harkness) grew to elevations of between 7,000 to 8,400 ft (2,100 to 2,600 m) at the corners of the central plateau. [26] Raker Peak erupted andesite lavas while basalt flowed from the others. Each of these volcanoes developed a cinder cone on its summit during their last stages of eruption. Later, a mass of rhyolite was forced through the north flank of Sifford Mountain and a plug of dacite was pushed up through the west flank of Raker Peak. [1] In the past 50,000 years, at least seven major episodes of dacitic volcanism produced lava domes and pyroclastic deposits in the Lassen volcanic area, and another five episodes produced basaltic and andesitic lava flows. [4] Eruptions have occurred at sites including Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat (explosive dacite eruptions followed by dome growth) and Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak (basalt eruptions). [4] In addition, about 30 smaller volcanoes erupted basaltic lavas in the larger region surrounding the Lassen volcanic center. [4] These volcanoes are geologically related to the Basin and Range volcanic province. [15]",

        "text": "Radiometric dating indicates that around 31,000 years ago a new vent opened up on the northeastern slope of Tehama, probably close to where Lassen Peak now stands. [27] Streams of fluid dacite flowed chiefly toward the north, reaching a thickness of 1,500 ft (460 m) and covering perhaps 20 square miles (52 km 2 ). [1] [28] Known as the Loomis Sequence, [28] these pre-Lassen dacites are the black, glassy, columnar lavas that now surround Lassen Peak. [11] Sometime between 25,000 and 31,000 years ago, Lassen Peak, a Pelean lava dome volcano, was pushed up through the pre-Lassen dacites. [27] Lassen grew past the normal maximum size of plug dome volcanoes, 1,000 ft (300 m), and reached a height of 1,800 feet (550 m) above the surrounding plateau [27] in as little as a few years. [3] The growth of the pile of lava shattered the rocks previously there, forming enormous banks of talus . [23] When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby Chaos Crags domes do today, with steep sides covered by angular rock talus. Lassen Peak's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation . [4] In turn the growth of Lassen Peak intercepted moisture, allowing a glacier on its northern flank to grow to almost 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) long. [29] Later, but not precisely dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. [4] Crescent Crater, which at first glance appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. [31] Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain , Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak and Vulcan's Castle. [23] An upper limit of 10,000 years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). [1] All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity. [1]",

Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier. [1] Reading Peak formed a second center from which ice moved north into Hat Creek and Summit Creek. Ice moving southward united with some of the above glaciers and emptied into Warner Valley. On the central plateau, the ridge connecting Hat Mountain with Crater Butte served as a divide between ice flowing northward to Badger Flat and Hat Creek and that moving southward to Corral Meadows, Kings Creek and Warner Valley. Ice from Mount Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley. [1] The crest of Saddle Mountain served as a divide with ice north of it moving into the depression containing Snag and Butte Lakes, while those to the south entered Warner Valley. The ice varied from a thickness of 1,600 ft (490 m) in Warner Valley to much thinner sheets in the higher mountains. [1]",

Then about 1,100 years ago several dacitic domes, the Chaos Crags, protruded through these cones and obliterated all but half of the southernmost cone. At least 300 years ago a series of large avalanches, possibly triggered by steam explosions , occurred on the north side of the Crags. [34] These avalanches created their own 'air cushions' that helped accelerate them to speeds exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h) and push them partway up Table Mountain. [34] The resulting wilderness of debris, the Chaos Jumbles, covers an area of 2.5 sq mi (6.5 km 2 ). [1] Manzanita Lake was formed as a result of Manzanita Creek being dammed by the debris. [26] Steam rose from the domes of Chaos Crags until 1857. [34] Around the mid-18th century a series of eruptions produced Cinder Cone in the northeast corner of the park, mantling an area of 30 sq mi (78 km 2 ) with ejecta in the process. [1] Ash falling on the streams of lava pouring from the cone's east flank formed the Painted Dunes. [35] A flow of quartz-studded basalt lava (the Fantastic Lava Beds) poured from the Cinder Cone and dammed the streams that run towards Butte Lake to the north and Snag Lake to the south. [33]",

[24] Extensive lahars (mudflows) were created on the northeastern side as snowbanks were melted. The resulting debris swept down the slope. Divided by Raker Peak, part of this mudflow raced down Lost Creek; the remaining flow passed over the rise 100 ft (30 m) east of the park road and rushed down Hat Creek. [1] A wide barren swath was torn through the forest. [1] A great explosion blasted out a new crater three days later on May 22. A volcanic cloud rose 40,000 ft (12,000 m), but a portion of the explosive force was deflected downward. [1] The resulting pyroclastic flow of super-heated gas, rocks and ash roared down the same path taken by the mudflow, resulting in further damage along the headwaters of Hat and Lost Creeks. Ash from the eruption blew eastward with some fine ash falling at least as far as 200 mi (320 km) from the volcano. [4] The last major eruptions of Lassen Peak occurred in April through June 1917, when a new crater was created at the summit of the mountain. Less explosive activity continued through 1921. [1] [24] The Smithsonian considers the eruption of Mount Lassen to have ended on June 29, 1917. [36] Since then, the volcano has been dormant, although some steam still rises from small vents in its summit and on its flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington ). [37]",

        "text": "The Lassen area remains volcanically active. The most common volcanic activity over the last 50,000 years in the Lassen volcanic area consists of small to moderate-sized eruptions that produce basaltic lava flows and localized ash falls. [4] These eruptions typically last a few months to a year, but may continue for several years. They can cover more than 1 sq mi (2.6 km 2 ) with lava flows, build cinder cones as high as 1,000 ft (300 m), and blanket many square miles (square kilometers) with ash a few inches (several cm) to about three feet (one meter) deep. Because these eruptions are relatively nonviolent, they rarely cause human fatalities. [4] Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area typically begin with steam explosions caused by the interaction of rising magma with ground water. [4] When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (about 8 km) of the vent with a thick layer of pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft , particularly those with jet engines . [4] The areas of highest hazard are those that could be affected by pyroclastic flows and lahars. These areas, including Hat Creek Valley , are those in the immediate vicinity and downhill from likely eruption sites. Fallout of ash will affect areas downwind at the time of an eruption. Within the hazard zones , relative hazard is gradational, decreasing away from the location of potential vents. [4] After an initial explosive eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such a sequence of events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000 years ago. [4] Interaction of hot pyroclastic flows with snow and ice can generate highly mobile flows of mud and debris (called lahars) that may rush down valleys leading away from a volcano. Because of this, active volcanoes that have a significant snow and ice cover can be particularly dangerous. The lahars that threatened residents of the Lassen area in May 1915 were generated by relatively small eruptions of Lassen Peak. Nonetheless, they traveled down creek beds as far as 12 mi (19 km) and released floods that affected valleys for 30 mi (48 km) downstream. [4]",

Recently erupted volcanic domes are unstable and can collapse, generating small to large rockfalls. Approximately 350 years ago, collapse of one of the Chaos Crags domes generated huge rockfalls, creating an area now called the Chaos Jumbles . [4] The first and largest of these traveled 4 mi (6.4 km) downslope and was able to climb 400 feet (120 m) up the side of Table Mountain. The trigger for the rockfall is unknown, but was most likely a large earthquake . Normal weathering also weakens fractured volcanic rock and contributes to small rockfalls. In the summer of 1994, a rockfall of 13,000 cu yd (9,900 m 3 ) occurred on the northeastern flank of Lassen Peak. [4] During periods of extreme rainfall or snow melt, mudflows are sometimes generated by mobilization of loose volcanic debris and soil on the slopes of volcanoes. [4] The only current visible activity in the Lassen volcanic area is from the various geothermal areas in Lassen Volcanic National Park ; boiling hot springs , bubbling mud pots and fuming fumaroles . Most of these features lie in or are closely adjacent to Mount Tehama 's caldera. In each thermal area, the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole 198 °F (92 °C ) at Bumpass Hell and 191 °F (88 °C) on the northwest flanks of Lassen Peak. [1] The hottest and most vigorous hydrothermal features in the Lassen volcanic area are at Bumpass Hell, which marks the principal area of upflow and steam discharge from the Lassen hydrothermal system. A prominent steam plume marks the site of Big Boiler, the largest fumarole in the park. The temperature of the high-velocity steam jetting from it has been measured as high as 322 °F (161 °C). [38] A thin crust of material often covers these boiling hot features, making them a serious burn hazard to anyone walking off trail. [39] The waters of the features are typically acidic and, even if cool enough, are not safe for bathing. [40]",

        "text": "Since 1898, geologists recognized that Mount Rainier was historically higher. In 1963, D.R. Crandell inferred that the “missing summit” had collapsed down the northeast side becoming the Osceola Mudflow. A semicircular amphitheater would have opened to the northeast. The depression then filled over time with ice ( Emmons Glacier ) and lava flows from a central vent. Russell Cliff , Liberty Cap , Point Success , and Disappointment Cleaver , surround this feature. [1] Using the dipping lava beds upward, it has been estimated the height of Mount Rainier was about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft). This is similar to the depression in Mount St. Helens from the eruption of May 18, 1980. Using information from the Mount St. Helens crater the volume of Mount Rainier collapsed has been calculated to be 2.0 to 2.5 cubic kilometres (0.48 to 0.60 cu mi) [1] An analysis of the clay and altered minerals like smectite , kaolinite , halloysite , mica , cristobalite , opal , and hematite in Osceola deposits with the same minerals in outcrops on Mount Rainier show that the mudflow began as a huge avalanche from this area.
