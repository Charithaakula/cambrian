## Cambrian-10M Instruction Tuning Data
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/cambrian7m.png" alt="Cambrian-7M">
</p>


In this work, we collect a very large pool of instruction tuning data, Cambrian-10M, for us and future work to study data in training MLLMs. In our preliminary study, we filter the data down to a high quality set of 7M curated data points, which we call Cambrian-7M.
Both of these datasets are available in the following Hugging Face Dataset: [Cambrian-10M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M).

### Data Collection
We collected a diverse range of visual instruction tuning data from various sources, including VQA, visual conversation, and embodied visual interaction. To ensure high-quality, reliable, and large-scale knowledge data, we designed an Internet Data Engine.

Additionally, we observed that VQA data tends to generate very short outputs, creating a distribution shift from the training data. To address this issue, we leveraged GPT-4v and GPT-4o to create extended responses and more creative data.

#### Data Engine for Knowledge Data
To resolve the inadequacy of science-related data, we designed an Internet Data Engine to collect reliable science-related VQA data. This engine can be applied to collect data on any topic. Using this engine, we collected an additional 161k science-related visual instruction tuning data points, increasing the total data in this domain by 400%! If you want to use this part of data, please use this [jsonl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M/blob/main/jsons/data_engine_161k.jsonl).

#### GPT-4v Distilled Visual Instruction Tuning Data
We used GPT-4v to create an additional 77k data points. This data either uses GPT-4v to rewrite the original answer-only VQA into longer answers with more detailed responses or generates visual instruction tuning data based on the given image. If you want to use this part of data, please use this [jsonl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M/resolve/main/jsons/gpt4v_77k.jsonl).

#### GPT-4o Distilled Creative Chat Data
We used GPT-4o to create an additional 60k creative data points. This data encourages the model to generate very long responses and often contains highly creative questions, such as writing a poem, composing a song, and more. If you want to use this part of data, please use this [jsonl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M/blob/main/jsons/gpt4o_60k.jsonl).

### Data Curation

We conducted an initial study on data curation by:
1. Setting a threshold $t$ to filter the number of samples from a single data source.
2. Studying the data ratio.

Empirically, we found that setting $t$ to 350k yields the best results. Additionally, we conducted data ratio experiments and determined the following optimal data ratio:

| Category   | Data Ratio |
|------------|:----------:|
| **Language**   | 21.00%     |
| **General**    | 34.52%     |
| **OCR**        | 27.22%     |
| **Counting**   | 8.71%      |
| **Math**       | 7.20%      |
| **Code**       | 0.87%      |
| **Science**    | 0.88%      |

Compared to the previous LLaVA-665K model, scaling up and improved data curation significantly enhance model performance, as shown in the table below:

| Model          | Average | General Knowledge | OCR   | Chart | Vision-Centric |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|-------|-------|----------------|
| LLaVA-665K     | 40.4    | 64.7              | 45.2  | 20.8  | 31.0           |
| Cambrian-10M   | 53.8    | 68.7              | 51.6  | 47.1  | 47.6           |
| Cambrian-7M    | **54.8**| **69.6**          | **52.6** | **47.3** | **49.5**   |

### Adding System Prompt to Alleviate the "Answer Machine" Phenomenon

While training with Cambrian-7M provides competitive benchmark results, we observed that the model tends to output shorter responses and act like a question-answer machine. This behavior, which we refer as the "Answer Machine" phenomenon, can limit the model's usefulness in more complex interactions.

We found that adding a system prompt such as *"Answer the question using a single word or phrase."* can help mitigate the issue. This approach encourages the model to provide such concise answers only when it is contextually appropriate. For more details, please refer to our paper.

We have also curated a dataset, [Cambrian-7M *with* system prompt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M/blob/main/jsons/Cambrian7M_withsystemprompt.jsonl), which includes the system prompt to enhance the model's creativity and chat ability.

## Train

Below is the latest training configuration for Cambrian-1.

In the Cambrian-1 paper, we conduct extensive studies to demonstrate the necessity of two-stage training. Cambrian-1 training consists of two stages: 

1. **Visual Connector Training**: We use a mixed [2.5M Cambrian Alignment Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-Alignment) to train a Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA) that connects *frozen pretrained* vision encoders to a *frozen LLM*.
2. **Instruction Tuning**: We use [curated Cambrian-7M instruction tuning data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M) to train both the visual connector and LLM.

Cambrian-1 is trained on TPU-V4-512 but can also be trained on TPUs starting at TPU-V4-64. GPU training code will be released soon. For GPU training on fewer GPUs, reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly, ensuring the global batch size remains the same: `per_device_train_batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` x `num_gpus`.

### Hyperparameters

Both hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below.

#### 1. Visual Connector Training

| Base LLM          | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | SVA Learning Rate | Epochs | Max length |
|-------------------|-------------------:|--------------:|------------------:|-------:|-----------:|
| LLaMA-3 8B        | 512                | 1e-3          | 1e-4              | 1      | 2048       |
| Vicuna-1.5 13B    | 512                | 1e-3          | 1e-4              | 1      | 2048       |
| Hermes Yi-34B     | 1024               | 1e-3          | 1e-4              | 1      | 2048       |

#### 2. Instruction Tuning

| Base LLM          | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length |
|-------------------|-------------------:|--------------:|-------:|-----------:|
| LLaMA-3 8B        | 512                | 4e-5          | 1      | 2048       |
| Vicuna-1.5 13B    | 512                | 4e-5          | 1      | 2048       |
| Hermes Yi-34B     | 1024               | 2e-5          | 1      | 2048       |

For instruction finetuning, we conducted experiments to determine the optimal learning rate for our model training. Based on our findings, we recommend using the following formula to adjust your learning rate based on the availability of your device:

```text
optimal lr = base_lr * sqrt(bs / base_bs)
```



### Download LLM Checkpoints 

To get the base LLM and train the 8B, 13B, and 34B models:

- **LLaMA 8B Model**: Download the model weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) and specify the model directory in the training script.
- **Vicuna-1.5-13B**: The Vicuna-1.5-13B model is automatically handled when you run the provided training script.
- **Yi-34B**: The Yi-34B model is also automatically handled when you run the provided training script.

### Training Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA)

We use a combination of LLaVA, ShareGPT4V, Mini-Gemini, and ALLaVA alignment data to pretrain our visual connector (SVA). In Cambrian-1, we conduct extensive studies to demonstrate the necessity and benefits of using additional alignment data.

To begin, please visit our [Hugging Face alignment data page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-Alignment) for more details. You can download the alignment data from the following links:

- [Alignment Data (JSONL file)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-Alignment/blob/main/jsons/alignment_2.5m.jsonl)
- [Corresponding Images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-Alignment/tree/main)

We provide sample training scripts in:

- [scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_8b.sh](scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_8b.sh)
- [scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_13b.sh](scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_13b.sh)
- [scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_34b.sh](scripts/cambrian/pretrain_cambrian_34b.sh)

#### Using Custom Data

If you wish to train with other data sources or custom data, we support the commonly used LLaVA data format. For handling very large files, we use JSONL format instead of JSON format for lazy data loading to optimize memory usage.




### Instruction Tuning

Similar to Training SVA, please visit our [Cambrian-10M data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M) for more details on the instruction tuning data. 

- [Cambrian7M Data (JSONL file)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M/blob/main/jsons/Cambrian7M_withsystemprompt.jsonl)
- [Corresponding Images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-10M)

We provide sample training scripts in:

- [scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_8b.sh](scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_8b.sh)
- [scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_13b.sh](scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_13b.sh)
- [scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_34b.sh](scripts/cambrian/finetune_cambrian_34b.sh)

### Options to note:

- `--mm_projector_type`: To use our SVA module, set this value to `sva`. To use the LLaVA style 2-layer MLP projector, set this value to `mlp2x_gelu`.
- `--vision_tower_aux_list`: The list of vision models to use (e.g. `'["siglip/CLIP-ViT-SO400M-14-384", "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336", "facebook/dinov2-giant-res378", "clip-convnext-XXL-multi-stage"]'`).
- `--vision_tower_aux_token_len_list`: The list of number of vision tokens for each vision tower; each number should be a square number (e.g. `'[576, 576, 576, 9216]'`). The feature map of each vision tower will be interpolated to meet this requirement.
- `--image_token_len`: The final number of vision tokens that will be provided to LLM; the number should be a square number (e.g. `576`). Note that if the `mm_projector_type` is mlp, each number in  `vision_tower_aux_token_len_list` must be the same as `image_token_len`.
The arguments below are only meaningful for SVA projector
- `--num_query_group`: The `G` value for SVA module.
- `--query_num_list`: A list of query numbers for each group of query in SVA (e.g. `'[576]'`). The length of the list should equal to `num_query_group`.
- `--connector_depth`: The `D` value for SVA module.
- `--vision_hidden_size`: The hidden size for SVA module.
- `--connector_only`: If true, the SVA module will only appear before the LLM, otherwise it will be inserted multiple times inside the LLM. The following three arguments are only meaningful when this is set to `False`.
- `--num_of_vision_sampler_layers`: The total number of SVA modules inserted inside the LLM.
- `--start_of_vision_sampler_layers`: The LLM layer index after which the insertion of SVA begins.
- `--stride_of_vision_sampler_layers`: The stride of the SVA module insertion inside the LLM.

## Evaluation
We will release this part of code very soon.
